Recently, I have been playing with some network gear from Ubiquiti. For a reasonable price, you&rsquo;ll get enterprise grade gear. Is it really that good? Let&rsquo;s check my non-unboxing review.</p><h2 id=a-bit-of-background>A bit of background</h2><p>I am a frequent reader of Mr Troy Hunt and when I read his article a few years ago about the <a href=https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unifi suite</a> that made want to try it again, a little. Just a little.</p><p>Indeed, I used to work with network gear, mostly Ubiquiti and Ruckus&mldr; The thing is, the company I was working at was offering a service : basically WiFi hot spots, based on a custom coded application + a bunch of open source tools. However, on the hardware part, our client would follow (or not) our recommendations. It ended in some companies or individual using very cheap Ubiquiti gear on pretty harsh conditions (think outdoor and ports with huge boats). I was a system administrator, but also worked the helpdesk (small startup for the win!). I was pretty quickly discouraged by all the issues I had on those cheapo setup, and all the calls I received during summertime. Add to this a very weak broadband connection shared among all customers, and it was really a hell.</p><p>Moreover, there was the horrible Java Unifi controller solution, years ago, before Docker was all the hype. I never liked to set it up, always afraid something weird will come up with Java. I have Java anxiety, but this is another story.</p><p>On the other hand, we had Ruckus systems (indoors), without any issue, and also more Unifi APs (indoors) as well, that we never had any issue with!</p><p>But as always&mldr; you remember the bad and forget the good.</p><h2 id=it-took-me-two-years>It took me two years&mldr;</h2><p>So two years after reading the article and coming back to it regularly, I decided to give Ubiquiti another go. After all, Troy is a semi god, how could he be wrong?</p><p>I bought the following stuff :</p><ul><li>1 x <a href=https://amzn.to/2OYbba8 target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unifi Secure Gateway</a></li><li>1 x <a href=https://amzn.to/2QWFS0Z target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unifi 8 ports PoE switch</a></li><li>1 x <a href=https://amzn.to/2DNJmjs target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unifi AP-AC Pro</a></li></ul><p>First of all, build quality feels really good, and it seems sturdy. We are very far away from cheap plastic equipment sounding (and feeling) hollow.</p><p>Installing it was really easy. It is literally &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo;. I plugged the USG WAN to my ISP&rsquo;s modem, and the USG LAN 1 to the Unifi switch, then all my devices to the switch, and the Unifi AP to the switch port nÂ°8 (on my model, it is the only port that supports PoE).</p><p>I had already prepared the <a href=https://www.masoopy.com/using-unifi-controller-on-docker/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Unifi controller in a Docker container</a>, so I browsed to the web interface and it magically saw all my devices : USG, switch and AP.</p><h2 id=i-fall-in-love-for-the-eye-candy-interface-and-ease-of-use>I fall in love for the eye candy interface and ease of use</h2><p>The web interface is pretty and easy to use. You have a main &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo; in which you see all your equipment along with pertinent information such as device name, IP, firmware version, etc. And also possible actions, like issue a reboot, update a firmware, etc. This is very convenient.</p><p><div style=text-align:center><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=/images/2018/11/unifi_dashboard-1.png data-srcset="/images/2018/11/unifi_dashboard-1.png, /images/2018/11/unifi_dashboard-1.png 1.5x, /images/2018/11/unifi_dashboard-1.png 1.6x" data-sizes=auto alt='<a href="/images/2018/11/unifi_dashboard-1-300x73.png" rel=""></a>' title=unifi_dashboard-1.png></div></p><p>From there, I &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; them one by one. It literally takes one click !</p><p>NB : Adopting a device is the Ubiquiti&rsquo;s way to &ldquo;unify&rdquo; all your devices, so that they are linked to your controller and you can manage them.</p><p>One the adoption was done, I could upgrade all my devices. Once again, it takes only one click (per device) !</p><p>Again, the web interface is really really nice, everything is very well integrated. You can see at a glance every devices connected to your network with a wire or via WiFi. I even discovered that my main computer was connected to both WiFi and ethernet&mldr; I probably forgot to disconnect WiFi after doing some tests a few days ago.</p><p>If you have several access points or switches, then you&rsquo;ll know every clients that are connected to them. This means that you can guess where your users are physically located. If for example, you have 2 APs, one called &ldquo;garage&rdquo;, located in the garage, and one called &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;, located in the kitchen and you see that &ldquo;Bobby&rsquo;s Iphone&rdquo; is connected to the Kitchen&rsquo;s AP, then Bobby is probably in the kitchen.. or he forgot his phone inside the fridge (not so probable)&mldr;</p><p>Another nifty feature is the &ldquo;DPI&rdquo; stats. It is pretty useless, but so cool that I couldn&rsquo;t live without it now that I know it exists. Basically, it is a graphic summary of what every device &ldquo;does&rdquo; on the network, and shows percentage of every activity like streaming, game, web browsing, etc.</p><p><div style=text-align:center><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=/images/2018/11/unifi_dpi.png data-srcset="/images/2018/11/unifi_dpi.png, /images/2018/11/unifi_dpi.png 1.5x, /images/2018/11/unifi_dpi.png 1.6x" data-sizes=auto alt='<a href="/images/2018/11/unifi_dpi-300x161.png" rel="">Unifi DPI</a>' title=unifi_dpi.png></div></p><p>I am not talking about the fact that, &ldquo;it just works&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t had any single issue with WiFi range, signal, or anything else.</p><h2 id=nothing-is-perfect>Nothing is perfect</h2><p>On the &ldquo;downsides&rdquo;, I was bit disappointed to see that Ubiquiti only offers SNMP v1 &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. Yup, no v2c&mldr; and not even v3! However, while the interface only mentions v1, it also works out of the box with v2c (I didn&rsquo;t check if it was read-only or not). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm-Z2ig6XMo" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">For v3, this is another boring story</a>&mldr;</p><p>As I already said, I could have used and love a more &ldquo;advanced mode&rdquo; out of the box. The advanced <a href=https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-USG-Advanced-Configuration target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">configuration of the USG via config.gateway.json feels counter intuitive</a>.</p><p>I was also disappointed by the fact that the devices run VERY hot. They are fan-less (which is &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, pun intended), but they are also very very hot. I am not sure how it would perform during summer, or during long periods.</p><h2 id=-and-another-week-later>&mldr; and another week later</h2><p>I decided I won&rsquo;t use it and had everything returned to Amazon.</p><p>My use case is pretty specific : I use an <a href=https://www.masoopy.com/watch-netflix-us-from-anywhere-in-the-world/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">OpenVPN client to watch US Netflix</a> and it redirects my TV through that VPN, while my other devices use my ISP. This can be done with the USG, however, it is really painful!</p><p>Moreover, I am also using <a href=https://suricata-ids.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">suricata</a> on my <a href=https://www.pfsense.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">pfsense</a> router, and as far as I know, it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with just the USG.</p><p>On the hardware side, I own a pretty decent setup :</p><ul><li>1 x router with CPU that supports AES-NI on pfsense</li><li>1 x Meraki MR33</li><li>1 x Netgear switch (to be replaced with Meraki MS120)</li></ul><p>With my current setup I miss the integration of everything. I have to browse to one page for the router, another one for the switch and a third one for the AP. Hopefully, soon enough I will be able to manage the switch and the AP at the same place. But still, the router will be left alone.</p><p>In the end, I have been very pleased with both Ubiquiti&rsquo;s hardware and software. I am glad I decided to give it another shot, even if I don&rsquo;t use it myself (for now). I would definitely recommend it and even set it up myself, just to enjoy one more time the slick interface.</p></div><div class=post><div class=post-info-share><span></span></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-navigation><div class="post-nav-box nav-box-prev"><a class=nav-box href=/install-windows-programs-like-a-boss-with-ninite/><span class=nav-icon><svg aria-hidden="true" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="chevron-circle-left" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M256 504C119 504 8 393 8 256S119 8 256 8s248 111 248 248-111 248-248 248zM142.1 273l135.5 135.5c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9.0l17-17c9.4-9.4 9.4-24.6.0-33.9L226.9 256l101.6-101.6c9.4-9.4 9.4-24.6.0-33.9l-17-17c-9.4-9.4-24.6-9.4-33.9.0L142.1 239c-9.4 9.4-9.4 24.6.0 34z"/></svg></span><div style=text-align:right;padding-left:10px><div class=nav-text-h>Next article</div><span class=nav-text>Install Windows programs like a boss with Ninite</span></div></a></div><div class="post-nav-box nav-box-next"><a class=nav-box href=/automagically-deploy-apps-with-gpo-and-boxstarter/><div style=padding-right:10px><div class=nav-text-h>Next article</div><span class=nav-text>Automagically deploy apps with GPO and Boxstarter</span></div><span class=nav-icon><svg aria-hidden="true" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="chevron-circle-right" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M256 8c137 0 248 111 248 248S393 504 256 504 8 393 8 256 119 8 256 8zm113.9 231L234.4 103.5c-9.4-9.4-24.6-9.4-33.9.0l-17 17c-9.4 9.4-9.4 24.6.0 33.9L285.1 256 183.5 357.6c-9.4 9.4-9.4 24.6.0 33.9l17 17c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9.0L369.9 273c9.4-9.4 9.4-24.6.0-34z"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div></div></div><div id=toc-final></div></article><div class="post-tags post-tags-toc"><a href=/tags/unifi/ class=tag>unifi</a></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer" title="Hugo 0.79.1">Hugo</a> | Theme - <a href="https://ublogger.netlify.app/?utm_source=https://www.masoopy.com/&utm_medium=footer&utm_campaign=config&utm_term=1.2.0" target=_blank title="uBlogger 1.2.0"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt fa-fw"></i>uBlogger</a></div><div class=footer-line><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw"></i><span>2022</span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw"></i></a><a href=# id=view-comments class=fixed-button title="View Comments"><i class="fas fa-comment fa-fw"></i></a></div><script src=/lib/smooth-scroll/smooth-scroll.min.js></script><script src=/lib/lazysizes/lazysizes.min.js></script><script src=/lib/clipboard/clipboard.min.js></script><script>window.config={"code":{"copyTitle":"Copy to clipboard","maxShownLines":10}};</script><script src=/js/theme.min.js></script><script src=/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js></script></body></html>
