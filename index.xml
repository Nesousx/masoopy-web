&lt;/div>In a previous post, I explained why I left Wordpress and how I did the move to Hugo. Now, let me explain how I write my articles.
Blogging in Markdown One of the main reason that me want to change what I used to do for several years was Markdown. I love the simplicity of this format, and it gives me great flexibility! I can start writing an article at home in my IDE, and continue it on my mobile phone, or from any computer using an SSH access.</description></item><item><title>THM - GameZone</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/thm-gamezone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/thm-gamezone/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Why change? I got fed up with Wordpress being full of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;, loading a webpage took ages (well, seconds&hellip;, but still too much) while my content is mostly text and a few small images.
Moreover, I wanted to be able to write my posts using Markdown.]]></description></item><item><title>HTB - NetMon without MetaSploit</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-netmon-without-metasploit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 14:56:25 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-netmon-without-metasploit/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">
