This is my personal website, about former ventures and current adventures. I am currently [learning to hack](https://www.masoopy.com/starting-my-hacking-journey-hopefully/) the hard way, and I am trying to do so [using cool tech](https://www.masoopy.com/going-from-wordpress-to-hugo-and-github-actions/)!

Do not hesitate to contact me there, and maybe propose a team of fellow learners!

Since I'd like to keep this website as much static as possible, I decided to get rid of comments and spam!

However, I would be glad to engage in a discussion and I can be reached :

* by email : `denis`[AT]`masoopy.com`.
