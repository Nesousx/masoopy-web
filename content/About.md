This is my personal website, about former ventures and current adventures. I am currently [learning to hack](https://www.masoopy.com/starting-my-hacking-journey-hopefully/) the hard way, and I am trying to do so [using cool tech](https://www.masoopy.com/going-from-wordpress-to-hugo-and-github-actions/)!

You can track my progress on the main hacking platform I am playing with :

{{< rawhtml >}}
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr>
<td> <img src="https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/nesousx.png" alt="THM"/> </td>
<td> <img src="http://www.hackthebox.eu/badge/image/399209" alt="HTB"/> </td>
</tr></table>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Do not hesitate to contact me there, and maybe propose a team of fellow learners!

Since I'd like to keep this website as much static as possible, I decided to get rid of comments and spam!

However, I would be glad to engage in a discussion and I can be reached :
* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nesousx) ; 
* by email : `denis`[AT]`masoopy.com`.
