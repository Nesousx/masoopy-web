This entry is part 1 of 4 in the series [Raspberry Pi](https://www.masoopy.com/series/raspberry-pi/ "Raspberry Pi")

In this first article, I’ll talk about the latest [#Raspberry](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspberry/) [#Pi 2](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/) hardware, and what you can do with it. In a latter post, I’ll detail various things you can do with your [Pi 2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T2U7R7I?ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&tag=kodi-xbmc-20&creativeASIN=B00T2U7R7I), and eventually in a last article I’ll guide you through the full install process. Stay tuned!

Compared to the Raspberry Pi 1 it has:

- A 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU ( vs single-core 700Mhz ARM1176 CPU on Pi 1)
- 1GB RAM (vs 512 MB on Pi 1)

Like the (Pi 1) Model B+, it also has:

- 4 USB ports
- 40 GPIO pins
- Full HDMI port
- Ethernet port
- Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video
- Camera interface (CSI)
- Display interface (DSI)
- Micro SD card slot
- VideoCore IV 3D graphics core

Price tag is the same, around $35. However, connectors are more easier to access, ie: located in a better way (see photos in this post), and the SD card has been replaced by a micro SD.

## Comparisons

So it is worth getting a Pi 2 vs a Pi 1? Yes, definitely! Unless you have only SD card left and do not want to buy a micro SD you should really go for a Pi 2 for the same price of the Pi 1!

Various benchmarks over internet show that the Pi 2 is about **6 times faster** than a Pi 1. However compared to&nbsp; “regular” small PCs such as NUC, the Pi 2 is much slower (and cheaper).

Keep checking us in order to see what you can do, and what you can’t with your Pi2 in a coming article.
