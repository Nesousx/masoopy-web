[#XBMC](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/xbmc/) / [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/) has a great feature : it can automatically download [#subtitles](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/subtitles/) for you. This is a pretty easy thing to set up. Let’s do it together now.

## First method to automatically download subtitles

The recent builds of Kodi allow you to directly manage this feature natively. This first method is the preferred one. However, it will only work in recent builds of Kodi. By recent, I mean around the name change from XBMC to Kodi. Which means it is not that recent. If you are using Kodi and not XBMC, then it should work. If not, then you really should update to Kodi.

That being said, let’s do it!

Navigate to _Settings_ > _Video_, then select the _Subtitles_ tab. At the top of the page select subtitles language :

![[subtitles_dowload_xbmc](/images/2015/04/subtitles_dowload_xbmc-300x167.png)](/images/2015/04/subtitles_dowload_xbmc.png)

Then, scroll down the page and make sure Auto download first subtitle is ticked :

NB: you have to[enable Expert Settings](https://www.masoopy.com/enable-expert-settings/) in Kodi.

## Alternative method to automatically download subtitles

In case your version is a bit a old, or if the first option doesn’t work as intended, you can use a small add-on in order to do the trick. I have personally used this method for years and it works flawlessly.

Navigate to _Settings_ > _System_ > _Add-ons_ > _Get Add-ons_ and navitage to the _Service_ category.

Select [AutoSubs](http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=198973) in the list and activate it / configure it according to your needs.

That’s it! Do not hesitate to contact us if you need help.
