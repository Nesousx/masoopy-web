The SuperRepo will enhance Kodi, allowing you to add and keep up-to-date thousands of add-ons.

## How to install SuperRepo on Kodi

![[Kodi_SRP](/images/2015/11/Kodi_SRP-300x165.png)](/images/2015/11/Kodi_SRP.png)Once done, it should look like this (notice SRP as name of media source) :

![[Kodi_Addons](/images/2015/11/Kodi_Addons-300x165.png)](/images/2015/11/Kodi_Addons.png)Then choose Install from zip, browse to the SRP repo you just added until, you see something like below :

![[Kodi_InstallZip](/images/2015/11/Kodi_InstallZip-300x165.png)](/images/2015/11/Kodi_InstallZip.png)Allow it some time to install the Add-on, once it is done, you should see it under Add-ons > Install from repository, as shown in the picture below :

![[Kodi_SR_Repo](/images/2015/11/Kodi_SR_Repo-300x165.png)](/images/2015/11/Kodi_SR_Repo.png)That’s it, SuperRepo is installed!

## How to install Add-ons from SuperRepo – enhance Kodi!

Now that SuperRepo is installed, you can start installing “real” add-ons to Kodi. In order to do that, browse to Add-ons > Install from Repository and select SuperRepo [All] .

From here, all the add-ons are sorted by categories, like video, music, subtitles, etc. You browse the list and install add-on you like. For example, if you are looking for a good add-on to download subtitles, I highly advise you to get the Addic7ed and OpenSubtitles’ ones from the Subtitles category.

A great streaming add-on, is Genesis from the Video add-ons category.

In order to install an add-on, just browse until you find it’s name (they are alphabetically ordered) in the right category, highlight it, press Enter and select Install.

Those are the add-ons I use the most. What’s about you, what add-ons do you use to enhance Kodi?
