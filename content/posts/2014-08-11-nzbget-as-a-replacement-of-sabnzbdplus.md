After years of Sabnzbdplus’s reign, a new tool doing for the same purpose was born: [NZBGet](http://nzbget.net/). In a few words, NZBGet has a lighter footprint on your system. It is coded in C++ whereas Sab is coded in Python. This means that NZBGet will run better on smaller system (such as NAS).

![[NzbGet_DL](/images/2014/08/NzbGet_DL-300x210.png)](/images/2014/08/NzbGet_DL.png)Configuring NZBGet can be pretty tricky for the first time, especially if you want to combine it with Couchpotato and Sickbeard and leave to them the post processing / renaming. I’ll write a little guide about this.

Of course, NZBGet (thanks to user made post-processing scripts) can [notify](http://nzbget.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=777) your media center [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/).
