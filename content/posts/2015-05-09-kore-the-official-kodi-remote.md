A few days ago, I was wrting about [my favorite Android remote for](https://www.masoopy.com/yatse-the-xbmc-kodi-remote/)##[#kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/).


Today, I present you Kore – the official Kodi remote. Let’s say it right now. Kore is pretty new, and works well. However, I find that so far it is **not as good as Yatse**.

Of course, you’ll find everything you can ask for a [#remote control](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/remote-control/) app:

- Control your media center with an easy to use remote;
- See what’s currently playing, including relevant information about it (movies, TV shows, music, pictures, files and addons);
- View and manage the current playlist;
- Change and sync subtitles and audiostreams;
- View your media library, with details about movies, TV shows, music and addons;
- Control Kodi’s volume with the hardware keys;
- Works with Kodi and [#xbmc](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/xbmc/) (Frodo and Gotham);
- Nice and easy to use interface, with multiple themes.

But I still think the UI is not really user friendly, especially when it comes to finding new subtitles; it lacks some polishing.

You can [download it here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kore) in order to make your own mind, and [find support / report bugs here](http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=129).

I’ll keep playing with it and update this post while I get more used to Kore, so keep checking it!
