Quick [#tip of the day](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/tip-of-the-day/).

## How to enable Expert Settings in [#XBMC](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/xbmc/) / [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/)

Navigate to _System_ > _Settings_. From here notice the _Basic settings_ button in the bottom left corner.

Navigate to it (yes, you can!) and just press your Return keyboard’s key. You’ll see that the button now reads _Expert settings_.

Job’s done!
