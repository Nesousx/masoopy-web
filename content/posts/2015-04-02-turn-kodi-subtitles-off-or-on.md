I have seen this question several time around internet: “How do I turn [#kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/) [#subtitles](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/subtitles/) off or back on?”


In case you want to turn kodi subtitles off or on (if they are already off) is a really simple process.

Actually, **all you have to do is press the “l” key** (L, as in “Leo”) while watching a movie in order to enable or disable subtitles.

You can also use the Kodi / [#XBMC](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/xbmc/) GUI to achieve the same operation, but I feel it be a little less convenient.

I hope this helps !
