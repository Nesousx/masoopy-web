Today, while setting up my Twitter account, I learned about a new [#kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/) Add-on called [istream from Xunitytalk](http://www.xunitytalk.com/forum.php). I will probably write about soon, when I have played with it long enough.

However what I also learned today was far more troublesome. **Some people, stole the great work from [#IStream](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/istream/)** in order to make a new plugin from it. I don’t want to give them any credit, but I feel obliged to name them : **AAA Stream**.

if you are using it, just know they stole the original source code and are potentially making money out of someone else’s work. **Do what you feel right** , ie: uninstall their plugin, talk about it, do nothing, etc.

As you can see **I felt right to share the word** , and I really hope noone will use “their” add-on.

This is my really small contribution and I hope it will help.
