Maybe you bought a new computer and reinstall it from scratch, or maybe you plan to sell your current computer, or maybe you just want to install Windows 10 as a new OS. In Any case, creating a bootable Windows USB stick will allow you to do so.

## It could be harder

This might sound scary, but it as actually very easy. However, please note that, for this method to work you'll need to proceed from a Windows 10 computer.

1. From you Windows 10 computer, grab the [Windows Media Creation tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616447) at Microsoft's website (should be the second link on the page) ;
2. Plug-in the USB stick ;
3. Run the Media Creation Tool ;
4. When prompted, select the USB stick you inserted ;
5. Wait for operation to complete.

And voil√†!

## Using it

Now, in order to use it, just plug-in the USB stick into your turned off computer, and turn it on.

You'll probably have to go into the "boot menu", generally by pressing F11 or F12 during the boot. If this doesn't work, have a look at your Bios settings (Boot section), by pressing DEL or F2 while the computer boots (before Windows lading logo).

Don't hesitate to share your thoughts!
