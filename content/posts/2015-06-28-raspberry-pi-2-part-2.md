This entry is part 2 of 4 in the series [Raspberry Pi](https://www.masoopy.com/series/raspberry-pi/ "Raspberry Pi")

In the [first part](https://www.masoopy.com/raspberry-pi-2-part-1/), we saw a brief presentation of the [#Pi 2](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/) hardware with some pictures. Now, in the sequel, weâ€™ll see what you can do with a [#Raspberry](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspberry/) Pi 2.

## Hardware applications

You could build a [Temperature and Humidity Sensor](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Temperature-Humidity-Network-Monitor/?ALLSTEPS), in order to monitor room temperature or help you grow vegetables thanks to the readings.

If you are the gaming type, you could always build an [Arcade Pi](https://arcadepi.wordpress.com/).

What about a [Pi Drone](http://hackaday.com/2012/12/01/raspberry-pi-quadcopter/)?

## Software applications

Of course the Pi, could also be used to [learn how to program](http://elinux.org/Raspberry_Pi_Programming).

Thanks to its very small form factor, it makes a great [pentest device to carry on site](https://github.com/pwnieexpress/raspberry_pwn).

Techy people could also use it as a [Pi OwnCloud server](http://blog.petrockblock.com/2012/08/15/your-own-cloud-server-with-owncloud-on-the-raspberry-pi/) in order to share files, manage calendar/contacts and much more !

Eventually, you could use your Pi 2 in order to install a media center such as [#OpenElec](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/openelec/) (based on [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/)).

As you can see, many things can be done with a $35 Pi 2. In a coming article, we will detail this usage, so stay tuned!
