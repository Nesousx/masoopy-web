## Recon

Usual recon here, based on logo and info :

* Windows box ;
* Misc : FTP, [Arbitrary file upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload).

## Enum

We run our classic `nmap` scan:

```text
sudo nmap -T4 -A -p- -oA nmap 10.129.98.161
```

```text

Our scan reveals an open FTP and a web server. Based on our initial recon, I guess we'll have to upload a malicious file via FTP and run it via the IIS web server! 

Before attacking, we'll check `searchsploit` for anything interesting.

Let's go!

## Exploitation

The server is running IIS, so let's try to upload an `aspx` shell. 

A quick search brought me to [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tennc/webshell/master/fuzzdb-webshell/asp/cmd.aspx), I uploaded it at root of the web dir, and it worked !

![Initial Web Shell](/images/2021/02/Devel_Initial_Shell.png)

Unfortunately, we are not `SYSTEM` and can't even access user's flag which seems to be called `babis`. It's time to escalate our privileges! But first, we should do recon from inside, let's upload the `winpeas.bat` file and execute as below :

```text
"C:\inetpub\wwwroot\winPEAS.bat log" 
```

This will generate a lot of info about Windows version, patches applied (or not), user rights, etc. This is a goldmine!
