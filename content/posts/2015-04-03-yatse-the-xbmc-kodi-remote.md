I personaly use a wireless “[keyboard touchpad](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKZTMG?ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&tag=kodi-xbmc-20&creativeASIN=B005DKZTMG)” as remote for my [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/) box and I am very happy with it. This is a very basic, but it works, and it works really well.

However if you are looking for extra features then I highly recommend trying out [Yatse](http://yatse.tv/redmine/projects/yatse).

Mainly, Yatse will allow you to browse your media collection, see fanarts, read movies / episodes summary, launch a media.

While playing any item and in addition to classic play/pause/forward/rewind/stop, you can manage subtitles (download, turn on/off, sync), modify audio (source, volume), and much more.

Actually, Yatse can do everything you will usually do with the GUI, all that power at your fingertips with impressive colors and definition thanks to our latest smartphones.

## Set up XBMC / Kodi in for [#remote control](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/remote-control/)

Convinced? Good, let’s see how to install it.

Download and install Yatse on your mobile phone, [from this official link, here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree) Unfortunately, as of today, Yatse is only available on Android phones and tablets.

Run XBMC and navigate to System > Settings then select Services tab :&nbsp; ![[kodi services](/images/2015/04/kodi-services-300x167.png)](/images/2015/04/kodi-services.png)Then, configure the web server according to your needs :

![[kodi http](/images/2015/04/kodi-http-300x167.png)](/images/2015/04/kodi-http.png)Finally, make sure all remote control options are enabled :

![[kodi remote](/images/2015/04/kodi-remote-300x167.png)](/images/2015/04/kodi-remote.png)Run Yatse from your phone and follow the setup wizard.

As usual, to not hesitate to comment this post, if you require help.
