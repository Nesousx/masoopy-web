One of my favourite add-ons is no longer supported by its famous developer, Lambda. Let’s find out valuable Genesis alternatives for you Kodi installation.

## Genesis is dead?

Yes it is.. and this is sad… However alternatives exist !

As of today, Genesis is dead. Thanks a lot to this author for all the great work he did for us all.

Let’s now focus on a few great alternatives, before something even greater comes out of the dead Genesis.

## A few Genesis alternatives

EDIT : March 5th 2016 –> Exodus add-on has been released. It is from lambda, the Genesis creator and it is awesome. He promised us a new add-on and it now there. [Check our guide to install the Exodus add-on on Kodi.](https://www.masoopy.com/exodus-new-genesis-reborn/)

### SALTS

Stream All The Sources, will allow you to stream Movies and TV Shows. It aslo includes [trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv/) integration (via an API) so that you can keep track of the watched media and create watch list.

### GoMovies

From the author GoMovies, might be the perfect and “official” Genesis replacement.

### Ororo.tv

Also from the same author of Genesis, Ororo.tv is a valid alternative to Genesis.

### iStream

There is also iStream, that will allow you so stream Movies and TV Shows, [check my little comparison](https://www.masoopy.com/streaming-on-kodi-istream-vs-genesis/)(VS Genesis) from a few months ago.

Don’t fear, there is a handful of Genesis alternatives. Let’s name a few of them.

## Quick install guide

In Kodi, installing an add-on is pretty straightforward, it is a simple process :

1. Install the SuperRepo add-on ([see our step by step guide](https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-superrepo-enhance-kodi/)) ;
2. Browse to Add-ons > Repositories > SuperRepo > Video Add-ons ;
3. Find the add-on by its name, and install it.
