Remember a few days ago when we decided to [synchronize our watched media between Kodi and Trakt](https://www.masoopy.com/synchronize-media-kodi-trakt-plugin/)? Well, today, weâ€™ll do the same with Plex Media Center!

## Synchronize Plex and Trakt.tv

Basically, all you need to do is:

- download the latest version of the plugin, [from here](https://github.com/trakt/Plex-Trakt-Scrobbler/archive/master.zip).
- Place it in the Plex Plug-ins directory
- Restart Plex
- Inside Plex (from a web browser), go to Channel, and click on the little gear on the Trakt image:

- At the top, youâ€™ll see an URL from Trakt.tv, browse to that URL and enter the PIN code youâ€™ll get there in the box.

Now run a first sync (it will probably throws an error about channel beinig not available, just ignore it, and allow some time for the first syn to run. You can close your browser, it will just run in the background.

## Alternative methods

Since Plex can run on several platforms, installation steps may vary. If the above quick steps are not enough, then have a look at the [original website](https://github.com/trakt/Plex-Trakt-Scrobbler/wiki/Installation).
