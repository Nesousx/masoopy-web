It's been a while since I wrote here, hopefully I will be able to write more often and hopefully too I will be able to finally get into hacking properly.

I have been interested by InfoSec for many years. It mostly started a bit more than 10 years ago when I was reading a lot about pentesting : Kali was called BackTrack then, I played a lot with it and MetaSploit.. Read many books and spend some time playing with vulnerable machines.

I even found a few vulnerabilities in website (mainly by changing URLs and getting to resources I was not supposed to access). I never tried anything else without authorization, and I knew it was already "too much". Anyways, I did a few, and reported them to site owners. I was lucky and they thanked me, fixed the issue, asked me to test again and that's it. No money, no jail either.

Then, I got bored, I felt stuck at entry level of hacking and couldn't get past that point. I couldn't do sqli, I couldn't write my own scripts, I could only use ready to use tools and modify a few URLs. I felt like a script kiddy, and I gave up.

## It's not you, it's me!

I think I suck at things, even if I am now a Linux Sysadmin without any formal education; I can write some basic bash for my day 2 day homelab and job in order to automate things as much as possible.

Even though, I don't think I am really better now than I was 10 years ago I think it is time to get over my stupid fears and finally begin this hacking's journey.

Recently I have read a lot of stuff, again, about InfoSec, bug bounty scene and even pentesting. I will write more about what I found in another post. But one of the article or video (can't remember exactly) that had the most impact on me was from [@HakLuke](https://twitter.com/hakluke). Great motivational speeches and articles, I am now back in the game and hopefully for long this time.

## Back in business

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This mean I will try to hack my way through HTB boxes WITHOUT [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com). The goal of this is to understand all nuts and bolts of hacking, and hopefully pass [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) one day.

Now, don't get me wrong, MetaSpoloit is awesome! Probably too awesome for me and for now : I need to learn, and in order to do so I have to understand all the steps, learn the hard way... Try harder like we often read in the "hacker's community".

I will share my journey on a [dedicated category right here on Masoopy](https://www.masoopy.com/categories/hacking)!
