This entry is part 3 of 4 in the series [Raspberry Pi](https://www.masoopy.com/series/raspberry-pi/ "Raspberry Pi")

Today we’ll talk about media center solutions for the Pis. Let’s go!

## Media Center Distribution

One of the most common use of the Raspberry [#Pi 2](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/) is to build a media center out of it. In order to so, one have access to several different “tools”. Let’s do a quick presentation.

### [#Raspbian](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspbian/)

This is a Linux, Debian based OS (aka [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution)). Compared to more specific distro this one is a “full” OS, which means you have access to a web browser, office suite, media player, etc. If you know your way around Linux, you might want to install [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) and even add the [#Kodi](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/) software to it order to have a hybrid media center + regular portable PC.

### [#OSMC](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/osmc/)

This [distribution based on Debian and Kodi](https://osmc.tv/about/) is a pure media center, like [#OpenElec](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/openelec/). To be honest, I have never played with it yet. It looks good on paper, and I’ll probably test it soon and report on this site.

### OpenElec

This is the well known [Kodi distribution for the Pis](http://openelec.tv/). It is a great, stable and easy to use media center. If you only want a media center, then this the way to go (until I have tested OSMC and share with you my feelings).

### [#Pidora](https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pidora/)

[Pidora](http://www.pidora.ca/), is similar to Raspbian since it is a full OS, but it is based on Fedora (a different flavor of Debian Linux). Like Raspbian, you’ll have access to everything you need for a daily use : web browsing, photo / video / music watching, etc. And you can also manually add Kodi.

That’s it! Stay tuned for the next article explaining you how to install OpenElec on your Pi.
