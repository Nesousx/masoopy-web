            </div>After criticizing like crazy the first Shield TV, I decided to buy the Shield 2017 and give it a try.
Only morons never change their minds Let&rsquo;s say it straight away, I have now adopted the Shield TV 2017!
I also have the feeling that Nvidia also decided to slightly change their product. They are now offering 2 &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of the box :
 a multimedia version, sold only with the remote ; a gamer version, sold with an additional controller.]]></description></item><item><title>Why Nvidia Shield sucks?</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/why-nvidia-shield-sucks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 11:05:22 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/why-nvidia-shield-sucks/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Yes, it is true. I think the Nvidia Shield sucks!
To be 4K or not to be First of, resolution ! I have plugged the shield on 3 different TV :
a 720p one ; a 1080p TV; a 4K TV. On the 720p TV, the Shield can only work at 1080p which means non native resolution and big visible pixels.
On the 1080p TV, the Shield will only work a 4K resolution with reduced refresh rate (24Hz)… which sucks cause you can spot the big pixels from your couch and refresh rate make it looks “slow” or laggy.</description></item></channel></rss>
