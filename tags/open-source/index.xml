            </div><p>Today, while setting up my Twitter account, I learned about a new <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#kodi</a> Add-on called <a href="http://www.xunitytalk.com/forum.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">istream from Xunitytalk</a>. I will probably write about soon, when I have played with it long enough.</p>
<p>However what I also learned today was far more troublesome. <strong>Some people, stole the great work from <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/istream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#IStream</a></strong> in order to make a new plugin from it. I don’t want to give them any credit, but I feel obliged to name them : <strong>AAA Stream</strong>.</p>
<p>if you are using it, just know they stole the original source code and are potentially making money out of someone else’s work. <strong>Do what you feel right</strong> , ie: uninstall their plugin, talk about it, do nothing, etc.</p>
<p>As you can see <strong>I felt right to share the word</strong> , and I really hope noone will use “their” add-on.</p>
<p>This is my really small contribution and I hope it will help.</p>
