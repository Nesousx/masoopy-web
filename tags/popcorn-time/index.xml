&lt;/div>Dear all,
#Popcorn Time has closed Sad news, Popcorn Time is dead. Popcorn Time was a great software, however due its P2P nature, it was not safe as I explained a few weeks ago which probably lead to its death. Fear not, there are alternatives, and the best one is right here on this site.
The Popcorn time alternative The alternative is #Kodi along with a good streaming plugin such as Genesis.</description></item><item><title>Popcorn Time is not safe, use Kodi as an alternative</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/popcorn-time-is-not-safe-use-kodi-as-an-alternative/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2015 14:38:12 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/popcorn-time-is-not-safe-use-kodi-as-an-alternative/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>You have probably heard of Popcorn time. It is a great piece of software allowing you to stream Movies and TV Shows. However, #Popcorn Time is not safe, you should use #Kodi as an alternative. Here is why.
Kodi, thanks to some nifty plugins can allow you to stream movies and TV shows, just like Popcorn time. There is however one big difference.
Kodi streams its data directly from “established” websites, this is what we call “direct download” or direct streaming.</description></item></channel></rss>
