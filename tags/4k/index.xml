&lt;/div>Yes, it is true. I think the Nvidia Shield sucks!
To be 4K or not to be First of, resolution ! I have plugged the shield on 3 different TV :
a 720p one ; a 1080p TV; a 4K TV. On the 720p TV, the Shield can only work at 1080p which means non native resolution and big visible pixels.
On the 1080p TV, the Shield will only work a 4K resolution with reduced refresh rate (24Hz)… which sucks cause you can spot the big pixels from your couch and refresh rate make it looks “slow” or laggy.</description></item><item><title>Is Kodi 4K ready?</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/is-kodi-4k-ready/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2015 12:21:10 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/is-kodi-4k-ready/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">
