<p>Today we’ll talk about media center solutions for the Pis. Let’s go!</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="media-center-distribution">Media Center Distribution</h2>
<p>One of the most common use of the Raspberry <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pi 2</a> is to build a media center out of it. In order to so, one have access to several different “tools”. Let’s do a quick presentation.</p>
<h3 id="raspbianhttpswwwmasoopycomtagraspbian"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspbian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Raspbian</a></h3>
<p>This is a Linux, Debian based OS (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">distribution</a>). Compared to more specific distro this one is a “full” OS, which means you have access to a web browser, office suite, media player, etc. If you know your way around Linux, you might want to install <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Raspbian</a> and even add the <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Kodi</a> software to it order to have a hybrid media center + regular portable PC.</p>
<h3 id="osmchttpswwwmasoopycomtagosmc"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/osmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#OSMC</a></h3>
<p>This <a href="https://osmc.tv/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">distribution based on Debian and Kodi</a> is a pure media center, like <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/openelec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#OpenElec</a>. To be honest, I have never played with it yet. It looks good on paper, and I’ll probably test it soon and report on this site.</p>
<h3 id="openelec">OpenElec</h3>
<p>This is the well known <a href="http://openelec.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Kodi distribution for the Pis</a>. It is a great, stable and easy to use media center. If you only want a media center, then this the way to go (until I have tested OSMC and share with you my feelings).</p>
<h3 id="pidorahttpswwwmasoopycomtagpidora"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pidora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pidora</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pidora.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pidora</a>, is similar to Raspbian since it is a full OS, but it is based on Fedora (a different flavor of Debian Linux). Like Raspbian, you’ll have access to everything you need for a daily use : web browsing, photo / video / music watching, etc. And you can also manually add Kodi.</p>
<p>That’s it! Stay tuned for the next article explaining you how to install OpenElec on your Pi.</p>
