&lt;/div>It has been a long time without posting. Today, I am back, and I hope I’ll be able to keep this website updated.
Lately, I have totally changed my way of watching media. For years, I used to get my media from newsgroups and store them and my custom built NAS. Since I discovered streaming plugins, I no longer store media, so that I can focus on backing up my data from my several computers to the NAS.</description></item><item><title>When morons steal IStream's code</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/when-morons-steal-istreams-code/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2015 10:48:56 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/when-morons-steal-istreams-code/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>Today, while setting up my Twitter account, I learned about a new #kodi Add-on called istream from Xunitytalk. I will probably write about soon, when I have played with it long enough.
However what I also learned today was far more troublesome. Some people, stole the great work from #IStream in order to make a new plugin from it. I don’t want to give them any credit, but I feel obliged to name them : AAA Stream.</description></item></channel></rss>
