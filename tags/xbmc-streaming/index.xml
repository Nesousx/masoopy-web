<h2 id="popcorn-timehttpswwwmasoopycomtagpopcorn-time-has-closed"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/popcorn-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Popcorn Time</a> has closed</h2>
<p>Sad news, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/popcorn-time-chaos-triggers-more-downtime-151023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn Time is dead</a>. Popcorn Time was a great software, however due its P2P nature, it was not safe <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/why-you-should-use-kodi-instead-of-popcorn-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as I explained</a> a few weeks ago which probably lead to its death. Fear not, there are alternatives, and the best one is right here on this site.</p>
<h2 id="the-popcorn-time-alternative">The Popcorn time alternative</h2>
<p>The alternative is <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kodi</a> along with a good streaming plugin such as Genesis. Is is really easy to set up and can be done in a few steps that are already covered on this website on the following 2 articles.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/how-to-install-kodi-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Kodi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-genesis-stream-tv-shows-and-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Genesis</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Just follow through the first and then proceed to the second article and you will be set.</p>
<p>This method will allow you to stream movies and TV Shows exactly like Popcorn Time (minus the interface which will be different) and very important, it’ll be a lot safer.</p>
<p>It’s time to keep up your couch’s potatoes skill.</p>
