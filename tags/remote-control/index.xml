&lt;/div>A few days ago, I was wrting about my favorite Android remote for###kodi.
Today, I present you Kore – the official Kodi remote. Let’s say it right now. Kore is pretty new, and works well. However, I find that so far it is not as good as Yatse.
Of course, you’ll find everything you can ask for a #remote control app:
Control your media center with an easy to use remote; See what’s currently playing, including relevant information about it (movies, TV shows, music, pictures, files and addons); View and manage the current playlist; Change and sync subtitles and audiostreams; View your media library, with details about movies, TV shows, music and addons; Control Kodi’s volume with the hardware keys; Works with Kodi and #xbmc (Frodo and Gotham); Nice and easy to use interface, with multiple themes.</description></item><item><title>Yatse, the XBMC / Kodi remote</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/yatse-the-xbmc-/-kodi-remote/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2015 19:44:28 +0200</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/yatse-the-xbmc-/-kodi-remote/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>I personaly use a wireless “keyboard touchpad” as remote for my #Kodi box and I am very happy with it. This is a very basic, but it works, and it works really well.
However if you are looking for extra features then I highly recommend trying out Yatse.
Mainly, Yatse will allow you to browse your media collection, see fanarts, read movies / episodes summary, launch a media.
While playing any item and in addition to classic play/pause/forward/rewind/stop, you can manage subtitles (download, turn on/off, sync), modify audio (source, volume), and much more.</description></item></channel></rss>
