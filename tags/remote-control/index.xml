            </div><p>A few days ago, I was wrting about <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/yatse-the-xbmc-kodi-remote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my favorite Android remote for</a>##<a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#kodi</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I present you Kore – the official Kodi remote. Let’s say it right now. Kore is pretty new, and works well. However, I find that so far it is <strong>not as good as Yatse</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll find everything you can ask for a <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/remote-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#remote control</a> app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control your media center with an easy to use remote;</li>
<li>See what’s currently playing, including relevant information about it (movies, TV shows, music, pictures, files and addons);</li>
<li>View and manage the current playlist;</li>
<li>Change and sync subtitles and audiostreams;</li>
<li>View your media library, with details about movies, TV shows, music and addons;</li>
<li>Control Kodi’s volume with the hardware keys;</li>
<li>Works with Kodi and <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/xbmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#xbmc</a> (Frodo and Gotham);</li>
<li>Nice and easy to use interface, with multiple themes.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I still think the UI is not really user friendly, especially when it comes to finding new subtitles; it lacks some polishing.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download it here</a> in order to make your own mind, and <a href="http://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find support / report bugs here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll keep playing with it and update this post while I get more used to Kore, so keep checking it!</p>

            </div><p>I personaly use a wireless “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKZTMG?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=kodi-xbmc-20&amp;creativeASIN=B005DKZTMG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyboard touchpad</a>” as remote for my <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kodi</a> box and I am very happy with it. This is a very basic, but it works, and it works really well.</p>
<p>However if you are looking for extra features then I highly recommend trying out <a href="http://yatse.tv/redmine/projects/yatse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yatse</a>.</p>
<p>Mainly, Yatse will allow you to browse your media collection, see fanarts, read movies / episodes summary, launch a media.</p>
<p>While playing any item and in addition to classic play/pause/forward/rewind/stop, you can manage subtitles (download, turn on/off, sync), modify audio (source, volume), and much more.</p>
<p>Actually, Yatse can do everything you will usually do with the GUI, all that power at your fingertips with impressive colors and definition thanks to our latest smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-xbmc--kodi-in-for-remote-controlhttpswwwmasoopycomtagremote-control">Set up XBMC / Kodi in for <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/remote-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#remote control</a></h2>
<p>Convinced? Good, let’s see how to install it.</p>
<p>Download and install Yatse on your mobile phone, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from this official link, here.</a> Unfortunately, as of today, Yatse is only available on Android phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Run XBMC and navigate to System &gt; Settings then select Services tab :  Then, configure the web server according to your needs :</p>
<p>Finally, make sure all remote control options are enabled :</p>
<p>Run Yatse from your phone and follow the setup wizard.</p>
<p>As usual, to not hesitate to comment this post, if you require help.</p>
