&lt;/div>#XBMC / #Kodi has a great feature : it can automatically download #subtitles for you. This is a pretty easy thing to set up. Let’s do it together now.
First method to automatically download subtitles The recent builds of Kodi allow you to directly manage this feature natively. This first method is the preferred one. However, it will only work in recent builds of Kodi. By recent, I mean around the name change from XBMC to Kodi.</description></item><item><title>Kodi subtitles out of sync</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-subtitles-out-of-sync/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 15:09:26 +0200</pubDate><author>Auteur</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-subtitles-out-of-sync/</guid><description>&lt;div class="featured-image">

&lt;/div>I have seen this question several time around internet: “How do I turn #kodi #subtitles off or back on?”
