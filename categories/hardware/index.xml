            </div><p>I love tech and I love to try new tech stuff. Recently, I have been playing with some network gear from Ubiquiti. For a reasonable price, you&rsquo;ll get enterprise grade gear. Is it really that good? Let&rsquo;s check my non-unboxing review.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-background">A bit of background</h2>
<p>I am a frequent reader of Mr Troy Hunt and when I read his article a few years ago about the <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/ubiquiti-all-the-things-how-i-finally-fixed-my-dodgy-wifi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unifi suite</a> that made want to try it again, a little. Just a little.</p>
<p>Indeed, I used to work with network gear, mostly Ubiquiti and Ruckus&hellip; The thing is, the company I was working at was offering a service : basically WiFi hot spots, based on a custom coded application + a bunch of open source tools. However, on the hardware part, our client would follow (or not) our recommendations. It ended in some companies or individual using very cheap Ubiquiti gear on pretty harsh conditions (think outdoor and ports with huge boats). I was a system administrator, but also worked the helpdesk (small startup for the win!). I was pretty quickly discouraged by all the issues I had on those cheapo setup, and all the calls I received during summertime. Add to this a very weak broadband connection shared among all customers, and it was really a hell.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was the horrible Java Unifi controller solution, years ago, before Docker was all the hype. I never liked to set it up, always afraid something weird will come up with Java. I have Java anxiety, but this is another story.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we had Ruckus systems (indoors), without any issue, and also more Unifi APs (indoors) as well, that we never had any issue with!</p>
<p>But as always&hellip; you remember the bad and forget the good.</p>
<h2 id="it-took-me-two-years">It took me two years&hellip;</h2>
<p>So two years after reading the article and coming back to it regularly, I decided to give Ubiquiti another go. After all, Troy is a semi god, how could he be wrong?</p>
<p>I bought the following stuff :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x <a href="https://amzn.to/2OYbba8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unifi Secure Gateway</a></li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWFS0Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unifi 8 ports PoE switch</a></li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://amzn.to/2DNJmjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unifi AP-AC Pro</a></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, build quality feels really good, and it seems sturdy. We are very far away from cheap plastic equipment sounding (and feeling) hollow.</p>
<p>Installing it was really easy. It is literally &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo;. I plugged the USG WAN to my ISP&rsquo;s modem, and the USG LAN 1 to the Unifi switch, then all my devices to the switch, and the Unifi AP to the switch port nÂ°8 (on my model, it is the only port that supports PoE).</p>
<p>I had already prepared the <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/using-unifi-controller-on-docker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Unifi controller in a Docker container</a>, so I browsed to the web interface and it magically saw all my devices : USG, switch and AP.</p>
<h2 id="i-fall-in-love-for-the-eye-candy-interface-and-ease-of-use">I fall in love for the eye candy interface and ease of use</h2>
<p>The web interface is pretty and easy to use. You have a main &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo; in which you see all your equipment along with pertinent information such as device name, IP, firmware version, etc. And also possible actions, like issue a reboot, update a firmware, etc. This is very convenient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From there, I &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; them one by one. It literally takes one click !</p>
<p>NB : Adopting a device is the Ubiquiti&rsquo;s way to &ldquo;unify&rdquo; all your devices, so that they are linked to your controller and you can manage them.</p>
<p>One the adoption was done, I could upgrade all my devices. Once again, it takes only one click (per device) !</p>
<p>Again, the web interface is really really nice, everything is very well integrated. You can see at a glance every devices connected to your network with a wire or via WiFi. I even discovered that my main computer was connected to both WiFi and ethernet&hellip; I probably forgot to disconnect WiFi after doing some tests a few days ago.</p>
<p>If you have several access points or switches, then you&rsquo;ll know every clients that are connected to them. This means that you can guess where your users are physically located. If for example, you have 2 APs, one called &ldquo;garage&rdquo;, located in the garage, and one called &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;, located in the kitchen and you see that &ldquo;Bobby&rsquo;s Iphone&rdquo; is connected to the Kitchen&rsquo;s AP, then Bobby is probably in the kitchen.. or he forgot his phone inside the fridge (not so probable)&hellip;</p>
<p>Another nifty feature is the &ldquo;DPI&rdquo; stats. It is pretty useless, but so cool that I couldn&rsquo;t live without it now that I know it exists. Basically, it is a graphic summary of what every device &ldquo;does&rdquo; on the network, and shows percentage of every activity like streaming, game, web browsing, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am not talking about the fact that, &ldquo;it just works&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t had any single issue with WiFi range, signal, or anything else.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-is-perfect">Nothing is perfect</h2>
<p>On the &ldquo;downsides&rdquo;, I was bit disappointed to see that Ubiquiti only offers SNMP v1 &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. Yup, no v2c&hellip; and not even v3! However, while the interface only mentions v1, it also works out of the box with v2c (I didn&rsquo;t check if it was read-only or not). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm-Z2ig6XMo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">For v3, this is another boring story</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>As I already said, I could have used and love a more &ldquo;advanced mode&rdquo; out of the box. The advanced <a href="https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-USG-Advanced-Configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">configuration of the USG via config.gateway.json feels counter intuitive</a>.</p>
<p>I was also disappointed by the fact that the devices run VERY hot. They are fan-less (which is &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, pun intended), but they are also very very hot. I am not sure how it would perform during summer, or during long periods.</p>
<h2 id="-and-another-week-later">&hellip; and another week later</h2>
<p>I decided I won&rsquo;t use it and had everything returned to Amazon.</p>
<p>My use case is pretty specific : I use an <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/watch-netflix-us-from-anywhere-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">OpenVPN client to watch US Netflix</a> and it redirects my TV through that VPN, while my other devices use my ISP. This can be done with the USG, however, it is really painful!</p>
<p>Moreover, I am also using <a href="https://suricata-ids.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">suricata</a> on my <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">pfsense</a> router, and as far as I know, it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible with just the USG.</p>
<p>On the hardware side, I own a pretty decent setup :</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x router with CPU that supports AES-NI on pfsense</li>
<li>1 x Meraki MR33</li>
<li>1 x Netgear switch (to be replaced with Meraki MS120)</li>
</ul>
<p>With my current setup I miss the integration of everything. I have to browse to one page for the router, another one for the switch and a third one for the AP. Hopefully, soon enough I will be able to manage the switch and the AP at the same place. But still, the router will be left alone.</p>
<p>In the end, I have been very pleased with both Ubiquiti&rsquo;s hardware and software. I am glad I decided to give it another shot, even if I don&rsquo;t use it myself (for now). I would definitely recommend it and even set it up myself, just to enjoy one more time the slick interface.</p>

                <img src="/images/2021/02/shield_2017.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>After <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/why-nvidia-shield-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">criticizing like crazy the first Shield TV</a>, I decided to buy the Shield 2017 and give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="only-morons-never-change-their-minds">Only morons never change their minds</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say it straight away, I have now adopted the Shield TV 2017!</p>
<p>I also have the feeling that Nvidia also decided to slightly change their product. They are now offering 2 &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of the box :</p>
<ul>
<li>a multimedia version, sold only with the remote ;</li>
<li>a gamer version, sold with an additional controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really think this is a smart move. It will allow Nvidia to target more users. For example, I have everything I need on the console / gaming side, and I am not interested in playing games on the Shield. Moreover, for occasional gaming, I can still pair my Xbox One (Bluetooth) controllers or any PS3 / PS4 controllers on the Shield. I bought this box to use purely as a 4K media center (I now have a 4K TV and the RPI3 doesn&rsquo;t really handle 4K).</p>
<p>However, for the people wanting using the Shield as a gaming console, they now have a totally redesigned controller and more importantly a regular sized / weighted controller! And if you don&rsquo;t like it, just pair almost any Bluetooth controller.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an improvement!</p>
<h2 id="shield-2017-as-a-media-center">Shield 2017 as a media center</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce the issue I had with the Shield TV plugged to a 1080p (only) TV since I no longer have it. So plugging the Shield to the 4K TV works flawlessly and 4K resolution and refresh rate are automagically detected, which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/60tooi/mibox_70_update_rolling_out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">not the case with a Xiaomi Mi Box 3</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, I was also bugged with the fact that Kodi (for example) will stop after a while and that some of the software I use could not notify it when new media were added to my libraries. I was probably dumb, or the option didn&rsquo;t exists (which I doubt). If you want to have your Shield always &ldquo;on&rdquo; (like my good old RPI3), then you simply have enable Developer Settings and activate the always on feature. This way, as long as my Shield is plugged and Kodi is running it will stay up, allowing third party apps to update Kodi library as soon as new media are available.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Shield that appealed to me was the Plex Media Server part. I used to run a Docker container with Plex Media Center, how my computer wasn&rsquo;t able to transcode 4K to something &ldquo;smaller&rdquo;. Now thanks to the Shield, my 4K media are transcoded correctly. This also allows me to have one less computer running 24/7.</p>
<p>In order to sum up, maybe the original Shield wasn&rsquo;t that bad on the media aspect but I was just being stupid.</p>
<h2 id="shield-2017-as-a-gaming-console">Shield 2017 as a gaming console</h2>
<p>I used to be a player, a PC player. I even worked for a fews years in the video game industry.<br>
Nowadays, not so much a player. I am getting bored pretty fast with video games and every few years I find a game I love and spend a few hours a day on it for some months, but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p>In order to write this article, I did try a few Android / Shield games, and I have to say that they are quite fine. They are a tons of them, and a lot are free (if you can endure the ads). This is definitely not a console I will play regularly or alone but if you have a few friends at home you&rsquo;ll probably find a game or two to play.</p>
<p>If you are into &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; games, like AAA, there are two possibilities :</p>
<ul>
<li>Geforce Now ;</li>
<li>Game-Stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still think that Geforce Now is still not interesting. It requires a lot of bandwidth and recent titles are not available.</p>
<p>Now there is the local streaming alternative. It is called Gefore Game-Stream and it allows you to stream games from your gaming computer (with an Nvidia graphic cards) to your Shield + TV. While I feel it works better than before : less latency, more games working &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;, etc.<br>
I am still not into it. I think Windows doesn&rsquo;t play well along it. This remains a regular PC, not a console and many actions have to be done with a keyboard / mouse. The Shield provide a pretty well done overlay so that you can &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; mouse / keyboard usage with the controller, but still&hellip;<br>
it is no fun to use. I really wish Windows would release some kind of real &ldquo;game mode&rdquo; / big picture interface. Then we would be talking!</p>
<p>Last but not least, the retrogaming part. I am not changing my statement by an inch on this. Reetrogaming still suck on the Shield 2017. You&rsquo;ll need good emulators and they are not free. And there is no nice GUI / frontend to serve you all your games at the same place. If you want retrogaming, use a Raspberry Pi with Retropie / Recalbox and some 8 Bitdo controllers. Way to go!</p>
<h2 id="we-started-on-the-wrong-foot-now-lets-be-friend">We started on the wrong foot, now let&rsquo;s be friend</h2>
<p>I have come to realize that maybe the Nvidia Shield doesn&rsquo;t suck as much as I thought. However, I also think that in order to enjoy it, you need a 4K TV. I also think Nvidia made a good job with its 2017 version by redesigning the controller and by offering the customer the possibility to use the Shield solely as a media center.</p>
<p>It is not perfect (what/who is?), but it looks like we are going to spend a few years of our lives together.</p>

                <img src="/images/2021/02/gpd.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Let me present you my latest gadget, the GPD Pocket a full HD 7&quot; quad core laptop, with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. It runs Windows 10 and more importantly (to me), it also runs Linux!</p>
<h2 id="quick-specs">Quick specs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intel AtomÂ® <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/93362/Intel-Atom-x7-Z8750-Processor-2M-Cache-up-to-2_56-GHz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">x7-Z8750</a> Processor (quad core)</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
<li>128 GB storage (eeprom based)</li>
<li>7000 mAh battery (12 hours announced battery life)</li>
<li>FHD 7&quot; touch screen (1920x1200)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="look-and-usage">Look and usage</h2>
<p>I love the look! It is small, lightweight, and seems sturdy.</p>
<p>I just feel like carrying it around all the time. Just throw it in my backpack and forget it until I need it.</p>
<p>However, while it can be handy to have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; computer (as opposed to a phone or tablet) always with you, it is still a gadget.</p>
<p>Still if you only browse internet and do light computer usage, you could use this computer as your main computer, plugged to an external display, keyboard and mouse. Then, as soon as you leave home, unplug the beast and carry it around.</p>
<p>You could also use <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2017/08/15/gpd-pocket-7-impressions-gnulinux-installation-and-offensive-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the GPD as a mobile &ldquo;pentest&rdquo; station</a>, for war driving, and that kind of stuff. This is what Simone is doing, and it is pretty cool!</p>
<h2 id="install-ubuntu-on-gpd-pocket">Install Ubuntu on GPD Pocket</h2>
<p>In order to use it, I totally removed Windows and installed Ubuntu &ldquo;custom&rdquo; images from <a href="http://apt.nexus511.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">here</a>. Let&rsquo;s see how to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li>From your &ldquo;regular&rdquo; computer, grab the desired image from their <a href="https://gpd-iso.dandinoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">repo</a> ;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/how-to-burn-an-iso-file-to-usb-stick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">&ldquo;Burn&rdquo; iso to USB stick</a>;</li>
<li>Plug-in the USB Stick into the GPD and hit Del while powering it on in order to access the BIOS ;</li>
<li>Follow the steps on screen, when asked something about using UEFI only, say yes.</li>
<li>Wait for installation to complete, when asked removed USB stick and reboot computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The installation is over and you should now be able to login with the user you created during the installation.</p>
<p>Now, any time you want to update your machine, simple open a terminal and issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install gpdpocket</code></p>
<p>While updating packages, pay attention to messages from your operating system. It might tell you that some packages were held back (especially kernel packages), if it does, &ldquo;force install&rdquo;. For example it says package kernel-plop and kernel-bob were held back, then issue the following command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install kernel-plop kernel-bob</code></p>
<p>At the time of writing, the latest version seems to have fixed the issue with USB-C data, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexus511/status/906534190669332480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">making it now usable</a>. However, I havn&rsquo;t teste it yet, due to lack of hardware.</p>
<p>So far, we have a pretty cool tool running GNU/Linux, but unfortunately it is not perfect.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-actually-shouldnt-buy-it">Why you actually shouldn&rsquo;t buy it</h2>
<p>The keyboard is really small, and the layout kinda sucks. It is is a non standard layout and it&rsquo;ll drive you crazy some (many?) times. I keep hitting the letter Q instead of TAB while in the terminal and it pisses me off&hellip;</p>
<p>The trackpoint looks like a thinkpad trackpoint but it is far less accurate&hellip; and you will do everything you can to avoid it. Some people will use the touchscreen, but I prefer to avoid mouses anyway and I daily use <a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">tiling window managers</a>.</p>
<p>If you start running some apps, it will be noisy&hellip; Of course you could <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDPocket/comments/6q74en/unlocked_gpd_pocket_bios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">flash the BIOS</a>&hellip; but this might not be a good idea.</p>
<p>Indeed, GPD people seem to offer pretty poor support on BIOS, and unsupported BIOSes are&hellip; unsupported and NOT reliable from what I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Moreover, when it breaks, or if you have hardware issue, support once again is less than average, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDPocket/comments/6sk56m/warning_gpd_kicking_support_back_to_dealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">it seems</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>For all those reasons, you&rsquo;d better to think twice, especially if you compulsive shopping disorder with this kind of devices like I do.</p>
<p>However, if you still wanna buy it, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-pocket-7-0-umpc-laptop-ubuntu-or-win-10-os-laptop--2#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">go there</a>!</p>

            </div><p>It has already been a bit more than 4 years now. Four years that the current gen consoles are disappointing.</p>
<h2 id="a-lost-generation">A lost generation</h2>
<p>Since the begining, current gen consoles have been outdated. About around the same time, the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/television/world-s-first-4k-tv-with-hdmi-2-0-launches-in-the-form-of-the-panasonic-wt600-1177981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">1st 4K TV was released</a>, while the current gen consoles could <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/PS4_vs._Xbox_One_Native_Resolutions_and_Framerates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">hardly provide 1080p at only 30fps</a>. While at the same time, the same games could be played with better graphics on a regular PC. It is also true to say that the PC was pricier. Games, however, on the PC were way cheaper thanks to Steam and many <a href="https://isthereanydeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">endless discounts</a>.</p>
<p>Still today, hardware wise, consoles suck! The new version released last year still canât run 4K! They can jst âupscaleâ to 4K. Which is clearly the 4Kâs of the poor. And it is even more frustrating when you consider than 4K TV and 1080p are now almost the same priceâ¦</p>
<h2 id="a-whole-lof-of-old-games">A whole lof of old games</h2>
<p>Even on the games part, those <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/playstation-4-yet-another-expensive-paperweight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">consoles suck</a>. I have one simple argument. There is more remake than unique / new games. Câmon people! Itâs been 4 years those consoles have been released, and we had the old gen for like 8 yearsâ¦ and game editors are stlll serving us the exact same food at the exact same outrageous price.</p>
<p>Yes, Xbox One and PS4, I am talking about you!</p>
<h2 id="current-gen-consoles-are-disappointing">Current gen consoles are disappointingâ¦</h2>
<p>However, there might be small exception. Itâs Nintendo. They might have failed the Wii U, however NIntendo is the only one to really innovate. They have first released the Wii (old gen), which have been copied by M$ with the Kinect and Sony with the Move. Then the Wii U and a very unconventional gamepad, and the Switch is on its way!</p>
<p>I am digressing but I even remember <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Glove" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">punching gloves</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">puking machines</a> from my youthâ¦ and it was Nintendo again!</p>
<p>Game wise, they donât do so many remakes and keep releasing a new âmarioâ on each gen and other new games.</p>
<h2 id="dont-get-me-wrong">Donât get me wrong!</h2>
<p>I am not a Nintendo fanboy. Far from it. I only own a Wii (and had a Nes, years ago). Then before being into computer gaming I was a Sega guy. At some point, I even despised Nintendo for the way they milk their customers. As far as I know, Nintendo is the only console manufacturer to decline its models in several revisions. Each of them adding a little extra to the previous version. Hence âforcingâ customers to acquire the latest one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just a few example. We had the regular Game Boy, then the Game Boy Play it Loud with colored cases but still in Black &amp; White. Then came the Game Boy color (with real colored screen). Same with the Game Boy Advance, Advance SP, Microâ¦ and then came the fat DS, DS Lite, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_video_game_consoles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">etc</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been doing this FAR more than their competitors. I have the feeling that they just only fixed a little thing here and then just as an excuse to release a not-so-new device.</p>
<p>However, today it seems that things are changing. Nintendo keeps innovating while others follow and publish refresh of their past bestsellers. I am not sure what will come in the next gen, but I am no longer excited about it.</p>

<p><strong>Redundancy.</strong> Wellâ¦ First of all, most of us already use a âclassicâ computer, or a set top box hooked to our computers. It makes the Android TV (or the box you already have) redundant.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep mode</strong>. If you are using some kind of software to keep your movies and TV show database up-to-date, it will have to notify your Kodi media center, as soon as a new item is available. However, as long as your TV is not running, it canât be accessed by any software. Which means, it will not update your libraries automatically. Youâll have to manually update it each and every time you start Kodi.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong>. It is not stable at all! Letâs say you watch a movies on Kodi every evening, then youâll probably have to restart the Kodi application every night before using it. I have noticed that every time I let Kodi run âin the backgroundâ for a few hours (because I donât use my TV, or play console on some other input) and start it again it is unresponsive. Add to this, the fact that sometimes some Android services just crashes during a video, which means youâll get a notification pop-up in the middle of your movie, and you must close it manually to get rid of it.</p>
<p>For all those reasons, Android TV sucks.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-really-that-bad">Is this really that bad?</h2>
<p>No, of course! It actually works OK and really allows you a lot of functionalities easily : thanks to your TV remote, you can also plug in your PS4 controllers, play some games, etc.</p>
<p>However, if you already have a working computer and/or set-top box, then you definitely donât need an Android TV, and you will definitely have a better experience with your actual configuration.</p>

                <img src="/images/2021/02/Nvidia-Shield-TV.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
            </div><p>Yes, it is true. I think the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U33Q940?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=kodi-xbmc-20&amp;creativeASIN=B00U33Q940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nvidia Shield</a> sucks!</p>
<h2 id="to-be-4k-or-not-to-be">To be 4K or not to be</h2>
<p>First of, resolution ! I have plugged the shield on 3 different TV :</p>
<ul>
<li>a 720p one ;</li>
<li>a 1080p TV;</li>
<li>a 4K TV.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the 720p TV, the Shield can only work at 1080p which means non native resolution and big visible pixels.</p>
<p>On the 1080p TV, the Shield will only work a 4K resolution with reduced refresh rate (24Hz)â¦ which sucks cause you can spot the big pixels from your couch and refresh rate make it looks âslowâ or laggy.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a 1080p TV with 4K resolution at 60Hz, not definitely not usable :</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, same 1080p TV but 4K @ 24hz :</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the 4K, it works as it is supposed to. But honestly, sitting on your couch a few meters away, it is hard to tell the difference between a 4K Shield TV vs a Raspberry Pi 2 1080p setup.</p>
<p>Without a 4K display, you will get worse graphics for 5 times the price of a rpi2. So, yes the Nvidia Shield sucks with non native 4K displays.</p>
<h2 id="the-gamepad-is-well-not-for-gamers">The gamepad isâ¦ well not for gamers</h2>
<p>Gamepad is pretty big, fat an heavier than any other gamepad. Holding it in your hands for a long time will be exhausting.</p>
<p>Letâs compare sizes on a picture :</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now about the weight :</p>
<ul>
<li>Shield gamepad : 315g</li>
<li>Xbox 360 PC pad : 250g (310g with the whole cable)</li>
<li>PS4 : 220g</li>
<li>PS3: 195g</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that weights have been rounded to the next upper value. The gamepad alone is heavier than the old gen Xbox 360 pad with its cableâ¦ and lot fatter to as the picture attests.</p>
<p>Once again again, the Nvidia Shield sucks as it makes you lift weights while you should be playing.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-platform-not-so-much">Gaming platformâ¦ not so much</h2>
<p>I am not sure what people are supposed to do with a Shield. Media Center ? Not really when you have Android TV stick and/or ChromeCast devices that are way cheaper, plug and play and run Kodi.</p>
<p>I believe the Shield should be good gaming platform, but no the Nvidia shield sucks at gaming too.</p>
<p>Android games ? No thanks, they work OK, but again if you want to play Android game buy a stick or an Ouya console. A part from a very short list of titles, youâll be able to play the same games.</p>
<p><a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/game-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Geforce Game-Stream</a> ? Well, maybe, but not today. This point could be pretty interesting. It allows you to stream almost any game from your running PC to your TV / couch setup. After playing with a it a little, I have to say that it is far from perfect. Some games donât play along, and it lags quite often, I used wired networking only. Actually, this point is not that bad, it kinda works. However, for the tech knowhow there is a free implementation called <a href="http://moonlight-stream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Moonlight</a> and it happens to work OK on a $40 RPI2. Moonlight is not as good as Geforce Game-Stream, but is playable most of the time.</p>
<p><a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/games/geforce-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Nvidia Geforce Now</a>, for about ten bucks a month, you can rent games and play them on your shield without having to use a computer. Everything from the game is âcalculatedâ on Nvidia cloud servers and you just stream it to your couch. However, youâll need the very HIGH bandwith (we are talking about 50Mbit/s for 1080p @ 60Hz as per <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/support/geforce-now/system-requirements/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">official requirements</a>) in order to be able to play any game. Moreover, most recent games canât really be rented but have to be completely bought.. and youâll sometimes get a key for your regular PC but not always. If you have a gaming computer, it is still better to buy the regular game and stream it thanks to Geforce Game-Stream.</p>
<p>Last but not least, playing old console games. I have already started a serie about <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/the-original-xbmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">retrogaming</a>. The Shield can allow you to run emulators, however the good emulators (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=.emu&amp;c=apps&amp;docType=1&amp;sp=CAFiBgoELmVtdXoFGADAAQKKAQIIAQ%3D%3D:S:ANO1ljJz6Ik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">.emu from Robert Broglia</a>) are not free. They are around $5 eachâ¦ and there is not many frontend, or they are not very nice looking. A âfrontendâ allows you to have a nice looking and consistent experience : all emulator are accessible from the same menu with a nice GUI. This is far more entertaining than the Androidâs way offered by the Shield.</p>
<p>A nice emulation frontend, <a href="http://www.recalbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Recalbox</a> :</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q5UYxuzKEec?feature=oembed" width="640"></iframe>
<p>Android emulators :</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IJEwiHBwKoM?feature=oembed" width="640"></iframe>
<h2 id="yeah-nvidia-shield-sucksreally">Yeah, Nvidia shield sucksâ¦really</h2>
<p>And I am really disappointed to say so. I bought it during a the black Friday and I was really hoping to find a great device, since I read many great reviews, but I am actually really disappointed. I am sending it back to Amazon. Iâll keep using the RPI2 with Recalbox. As for a media center solution, you could still use a regular Kodi installation with the right add-ons for streaming, as per our <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Kodi Beginnerâs Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Today weâll talk about media center solutions for the Pis. Letâs go!</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="media-center-distribution">Media Center Distribution</h2>
<p>One of the most common use of the Raspberry <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pi 2</a> is to build a media center out of it. In order to so, one have access to several different âtoolsâ. Letâs do a quick presentation.</p>
<h3 id="raspbianhttpswwwmasoopycomtagraspbian"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspbian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Raspbian</a></h3>
<p>This is a Linux, Debian based OS (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">distribution</a>). Compared to more specific distro this one is a âfullâ OS, which means you have access to a web browser, office suite, media player, etc. If you know your way around Linux, you might want to install <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Raspbian</a> and even add the <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Kodi</a> software to it order to have a hybrid media center + regular portable PC.</p>
<h3 id="osmchttpswwwmasoopycomtagosmc"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/osmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#OSMC</a></h3>
<p>This <a href="https://osmc.tv/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">distribution based on Debian and Kodi</a> is a pure media center, like <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/openelec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#OpenElec</a>. To be honest, I have never played with it yet. It looks good on paper, and Iâll probably test it soon and report on this site.</p>
<h3 id="openelec">OpenElec</h3>
<p>This is the well known <a href="http://openelec.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Kodi distribution for the Pis</a>. It is a great, stable and easy to use media center. If you only want a media center, then this the way to go (until I have tested OSMC and share with you my feelings).</p>
<h3 id="pidorahttpswwwmasoopycomtagpidora"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pidora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pidora</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pidora.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pidora</a>, is similar to Raspbian since it is a full OS, but it is based on Fedora (a different flavor of Debian Linux). Like Raspbian, youâll have access to everything you need for a daily use : web browsing, photo / video / music watching, etc. And you can also manually add Kodi.</p>
<p>Thatâs it! Stay tuned for the next article explaining you how to install OpenElec on your Pi.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/raspberry-pi-2-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">first part</a>, we saw a brief presentation of the <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pi 2</a> hardware with some pictures. Now, in the sequel, weâll see what you can do with a <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspberry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Raspberry</a> Pi 2.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="hardware-applications">Hardware applications</h2>
<p>You could build a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Temperature-Humidity-Network-Monitor/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Temperature and Humidity Sensor</a>, in order to monitor room temperature or help you grow vegetables thanks to the readings.</p>
<p>If you are the gaming type, you could always build an <a href="https://arcadepi.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Arcade Pi</a>.</p>
<p>What about a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/12/01/raspberry-pi-quadcopter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pi Drone</a>?</p>
<h2 id="software-applications">Software applications</h2>
<p>Of course the Pi, could also be used to <a href="http://elinux.org/Raspberry_Pi_Programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">learn how to program</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to its very small form factor, it makes a great <a href="https://github.com/pwnieexpress/raspberry_pwn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">pentest device to carry on site</a>.</p>
<p>Techy people could also use it as a <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com/2012/08/15/your-own-cloud-server-with-owncloud-on-the-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pi OwnCloud server</a> in order to share files, manage calendar/contacts and much more !</p>
<p>Eventually, you could use your Pi 2 in order to install a media center such as <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/openelec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#OpenElec</a> (based on <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Kodi</a>).</p>
<p>As you can see, many things can be done with a $35 Pi 2. In a coming article, we will detail this usage, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>In this first article, Iâll talk about the latest <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/raspberry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Raspberry</a> <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/pi-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">#Pi 2</a> hardware, and what you can do with it. In a latter post, Iâll detail various things you can do with your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T2U7R7I?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=kodi-xbmc-20&amp;creativeASIN=B00T2U7R7I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Pi 2</a>, and eventually in a last article Iâll guide you through the full install process. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Compared to the Raspberry Pi 1 it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU ( vs single-core 700Mhz ARM1176 CPU on Pi 1)</li>
<li>1GB RAM (vs 512 MB on Pi 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like the (Pi 1) Model B+, it also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 USB ports</li>
<li>40 GPIO pins</li>
<li>Full HDMI port</li>
<li>Ethernet port</li>
<li>Combined 3.5mm audio jack and composite video</li>
<li>Camera interface (CSI)</li>
<li>Display interface (DSI)</li>
<li>Micro SD card slot</li>
<li>VideoCore IV 3D graphics core</li>
</ul>
<p>Price tag is the same, around $35. However, connectors are more easier to access, ie: located in a better way (see photos in this post), and the SD card has been replaced by a micro SD.</p>
<h2 id="pictures">Pictures</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>
<p>So it is worth getting a Pi 2 vs a Pi 1? Yes, definitely! Unless you have only SD card left and do not want to buy a micro SD you should really go for a Pi 2 for the same price of the Pi 1!</p>
<p>Various benchmarks over internet show that the Pi 2 is about <strong>6 times faster</strong> than a Pi 1. However compared toÂ  âregularâ small PCs such as NUC, the Pi 2 is much slower (and cheaper).</p>
