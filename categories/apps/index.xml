<h2 id="netflix-allows-you-to-download-files-to-external-storage">Netflix allows you to download files to external storage</h2>
<p>Since its latest version, Netflix allows you to download files to external storage. This is a great and long awaited addition! Just head over the Google App store, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the latest version of the application</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the application;</li>
<li>Then go to Settings  &gt; Download location, and select your external storage.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="but-there-is-still-limitations">But there is still limitations</h2>
<p>At least a big one. All the content has a time limit. This limit will vary depending on content and / or location. In a few words, it means your content will expire!</p>
<p>When Hulu is also planning an offline mode, Netflix reinforces its offer. Now, time will tell how good and usable this feature. Should you download your media the day before you watch them while commuting? Or will you be able to watch the media for a 2 weeks vacations? Time will, tell…</p>

            </div><p>Dear all,</p>
<h2 id="popcorn-timehttpswwwmasoopycomtagpopcorn-time-has-closed"><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/popcorn-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Popcorn Time</a> has closed</h2>
<p>Sad news, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/popcorn-time-chaos-triggers-more-downtime-151023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn Time is dead</a>. Popcorn Time was a great software, however due its P2P nature, it was not safe <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/why-you-should-use-kodi-instead-of-popcorn-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as I explained</a> a few weeks ago which probably lead to its death. Fear not, there are alternatives, and the best one is right here on this site.</p>
<h2 id="the-popcorn-time-alternative">The Popcorn time alternative</h2>
<p>The alternative is <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kodi</a> along with a good streaming plugin such as Genesis. Is is really easy to set up and can be done in a few steps that are already covered on this website on the following 2 articles.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/how-to-install-kodi-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Kodi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-genesis-stream-tv-shows-and-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install Genesis</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Just follow through the first and then proceed to the second article and you will be set.</p>
<p>This method will allow you to stream movies and TV Shows exactly like Popcorn Time (minus the interface which will be different) and very important, it’ll be a lot safer.</p>
<p>It’s time to keep up your couch’s potatoes skill.</p>

            </div><p>You have probably heard of <a href="https://popcorntime.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn time</a>. It is a great piece of software allowing you to stream Movies and TV Shows. However, <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/popcorn-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Popcorn Time</a> is not safe, you should use <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kodi</a> as an alternative. Here is why.</p>
<p>Kodi, thanks to some <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/kodi-genesis-stream-tv-shows-and-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nifty plugins</a> can allow you to stream movies and TV shows, just like Popcorn time. There is however one big difference.</p>
<p>Kodi streams its data directly from “established” websites, this is what we call “direct download” or direct streaming. When you watch a movies, only you, the website owner and your ISP know what you are doing. If streaming such data is illegal in your country, then you want the least people to know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Popcorn time on the other hand, is a P2P system based on torrent’s files. It means the data you are streaming is shared by many people (can be up to several hundreds people, even more technically). In the end, you, your ISP, and everyone “sharing” the file know what you are doing. Among those people, some will be because they want to watch it like, some others just want to help and keep “offering” movies to everyone, and some others might be here only to “spy on you”.</p>
<p>To sum this up, Popcorn Time is not the safe to stream movies, and I’d avoid using it. Also please remember that streaming movies you don’t own the rights for is probably illegal wherever you live.</p>

            </div><p>I personaly use a wireless “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKZTMG?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;tag=kodi-xbmc-20&amp;creativeASIN=B005DKZTMG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keyboard touchpad</a>” as remote for my <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/kodi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Kodi</a> box and I am very happy with it. This is a very basic, but it works, and it works really well.</p>
<p>However if you are looking for extra features then I highly recommend trying out <a href="http://yatse.tv/redmine/projects/yatse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yatse</a>.</p>
<p>Mainly, Yatse will allow you to browse your media collection, see fanarts, read movies / episodes summary, launch a media.</p>
<p>While playing any item and in addition to classic play/pause/forward/rewind/stop, you can manage subtitles (download, turn on/off, sync), modify audio (source, volume), and much more.</p>
<p>Actually, Yatse can do everything you will usually do with the GUI, all that power at your fingertips with impressive colors and definition thanks to our latest smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-xbmc--kodi-in-for-remote-controlhttpswwwmasoopycomtagremote-control">Set up XBMC / Kodi in for <a href="https://www.masoopy.com/tag/remote-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#remote control</a></h2>
<p>Convinced? Good, let’s see how to install it.</p>
<p>Download and install Yatse on your mobile phone, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from this official link, here.</a> Unfortunately, as of today, Yatse is only available on Android phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Run XBMC and navigate to System &gt; Settings then select Services tab :  Then, configure the web server according to your needs :</p>
<p>Finally, make sure all remote control options are enabled :</p>
<p>Run Yatse from your phone and follow the setup wizard.</p>
<p>As usual, to not hesitate to comment this post, if you require help.</p>
