&lt;/div>Box HTB - NetMon
Intro An easy box according to HTB ranking and a not so easy one according to this site. For me, it was really painful. Let me overshare!
Recon Quick recon based on HTB logo and info :
Windows box ; Misc info : web, PowerShell, file misconfiguration ; Probably runs PRTG NetWork Monitor tool. Enum sudo nmap -T4 -A -p- -oA nmap $target_ip Starting Nmap 7.</description></item><item><title>THM - Alfred</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/thm-alfred/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 14:26:15 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/thm-alfred/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Box THM - Alfred
Intro Without further ado, let&rsquo;s get started and see what this box is made of!
Recon From the box logo and description we can discover that :
 Target runs Windows ; Target runs Jenkins.  Let&rsquo;s go!
Enum Let&rsquo;s start a basic nmap scan :
sudo nmap -T4 -A -p- -oA nmap $target_ip Unfortunately, nmap will complain that Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn.]]></description></item><item><title>HTB - OpenAdmin without MetaSploit</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-openadmin-without-metasploit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 12:42:29 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-openadmin-without-metasploit/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Box HTB - OpenAdmin
Intro The importance to also patch your &ldquo;applications&rdquo;, and not just your services.
Recon Again, this is an HTB box, so recon is mainly active, and I feel like active recon == enum.
Still, we can check :
 Name of the box : OpenAdmin ; OS &ldquo;type&rdquo;, : Linux : Hints given on HTB website, information section :   
Enum As always, we start with an nmap scan :]]></description></item><item><title>HTB - Blue without MetaSploit</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-blue-without-metasploit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 16:37:44 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/htb-blue-without-metasploit/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

            </div>Box HTB - Blue
Intro A good ol' vuln to get starting!
This will be my first real tutorial, so I&rsquo;ll try to explain the basics of what I am doing. Please bear in mind that I am very new to hacking, probably like you are. I am merely sharing my knowledge and by doing so I am making sure I understood what I did. Please correct me if you find anything wrong, or ask question if you need to!]]></description></item><item><title>Starting my hacking journey, hopefully!</title><link>https://www.masoopy.com/starting-my-hacking-journey-hopefully/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 12:21:29 +0100</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://www.masoopy.com/starting-my-hacking-journey-hopefully/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

Bosom buddies I have been interested by InfoSec for many years. It mostly started a bit more than 10 years ago when I was reading a lot about pentesting : Kali was called BackTrack then, I played a lot with it and MetaSploit.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
